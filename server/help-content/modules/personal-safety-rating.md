# Personal Safety Rating (PSR)

Your portable professional safety identity that follows you throughout your career, proving your commitment to safety with data, not words.

## Overview

The Personal Safety Rating (PSR) is your personal safety score that belongs to you, not your employer. Unlike company metrics that stay with employers, your PSR follows you when you change jobs. Every harness inspection, every quiz passed, every document signed builds your permanent professional safety record. Employers can see your PSR when reviewing your profile, making a high score a competitive advantage.

## The Golden Rule

> "Your PSR is your portable professional safety identity. It belongs to you, follows you everywhere, and proves your commitment to safety with data, not words."

### The PSR Formula

**Solo Technician (Not Linked to Employer):**
- PSR = (Certifications x 33%) + (Safety Docs x 33%) + (Quizzes x 34%)

**Employer-Linked Technician:**
- PSR = (Certifications x 25%) + (Safety Docs x 25%) + (Quizzes x 25%) + (Work History x 25%)

PSR creates quantified accountability. Unlike paper resumes or verbal references, PSR proves safety consciousness through verifiable behavior tracked across your entire career.

## Key Features

- **Portable Safety Identity** - Your PSR follows you when you change employers. Inspections completed at Company A count toward your score even after you leave.

- **Four-Component Scoring** - Certifications, safety documents, quizzes, and work history combine into one comprehensive percentage score.

- **Career Capital Builder** - Every harness inspection, every quiz passed, every document signed builds your professional reputation over time.

- **Employer Visibility** - Companies reviewing technician profiles see your PSR, making high scores a competitive advantage when seeking work.

- **Dynamic Quiz System** - Quiz availability adapts to your certification level and employer connection. Level 2 techs see more quizzes than Level 1.

- **Real-Time Updates** - Your PSR updates automatically as you complete safety activities. No manual calculation or reporting required.

- **Lifetime Aggregation** - Safety document score tracks inspections over time across all employers, not just recent activity.

- **Workforce Safety Score (WSS)** - Company owners see average PSR of all employees for hiring decisions (displayed only, does not impact CSR).

## Rating Tiers

Your PSR score determines your rating tier, displayed as a color-coded badge:

| Score | Tier | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **90+** | Green | Excellent | Top safety, highly sought after by employers |
| **70+** | Emerald | Good | Strong safety foundation |
| **50+** | Amber | Developing | Complete more quizzes and inspections |
| **<50** | Red | Low | Urgent improvement required |

## Component Breakdown

### Certifications (33% solo / 25% linked)

Your IRATA/SPRAT certification status and verification level:

| Status | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Valid and Verified | 100% |
| Unverified | 75% |
| No Expiry Set | 50% |
| Expired | 25% |
| None | 0% |

### Safety Documents (33% solo / 25% linked)

Your harness inspection completion rate over time.

**Formula:** Score = (Passed Inspections / Total Inspections) x 100

Calculated over your entire career across all employers, not just the past 30 days. Your inspection history is portable.

### Safety Quizzes (34% solo / 25% linked)

Your completion of available safety knowledge quizzes.

**Formula:** Score = (Quizzes Passed / Available Quizzes) x 100

Quiz availability is dynamic:
- Level 1 technicians have 2 quizzes
- Level 2 technicians have 4 quizzes
- Level 3 technicians have 6 quizzes
- Employer-linked technicians also get company document quizzes

### Work History (25% - linked only)

Your incident record while linked to an employer.

**Formula:** Score = 100% - (10% x Number of Incidents)
**Minimum Score:** 50%

Starts at 100%, minus 10% per recorded incident. New workers with no sessions start at 50%. Only applies when linked to an employer.

## PSR vs CSR

### Independence Principle

PSR and CSR are calculated separately. They do not directly impact each other. Your personal safety rating does not affect your employer's company safety rating.

### Key Differences

**PSR (Personal Safety Rating):**
- Belongs to individual technician
- Follows you between employers
- Employers see during hiring
- Based on personal inspections, quizzes, incidents

**CSR (Company Safety Rating):**
- Belongs to the company
- Stays with the employer
- Property managers see when selecting vendors
- Based on company-wide compliance and documentation

## For Technicians

- Complete your harness inspections regularly to build your safety document score
- Take all available quizzes for your certification level
- Keep your IRATA/SPRAT certification verified and current
- Your PSR follows you when you change employers
- A high PSR makes you more attractive to potential employers

## For Company Owners

- View individual technician PSRs in the employee roster
- The Workforce Safety Score (WSS) shows average PSR across all employees
- Use PSR to identify technicians who may need additional training
- PSR does not impact your Company Safety Rating

## Common Questions

**Q: Does my PSR affect my employer's CSR?**
A: No. PSR and CSR are independent scores. Your personal rating does not impact the company's rating.

**Q: What happens to my PSR when I change jobs?**
A: Your PSR stays with you. All inspections, quizzes, and certifications from previous employers remain in your record.

**Q: How often is my PSR updated?**
A: Real-time. Every inspection, quiz, or document acknowledgment immediately affects your score.

**Q: Can employers see my detailed PSR breakdown?**
A: Employers see your overall PSR score. The detailed breakdown is primarily for your own reference.

**Q: What if I'm not linked to an employer?**
A: Solo technicians use a three-component formula (no work history). You can still build your PSR through certifications, quizzes, and inspections.

**Q: How do I improve my PSR?**
A: Keep certifications current and verified, complete all available quizzes, perform regular harness inspections, and maintain an incident-free work record.
