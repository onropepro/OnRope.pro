# Time Tracking

Track work hours with GPS verification, manage billable and non-billable time, and prepare accurate payroll data.

## Overview

The Time Tracking module provides GPS-verified work session tracking for field technicians. Every clock-in captures location, timestamps hours automatically, and feeds data directly to payroll preparation. This creates an auditable trail from field work to financial reporting.

## Key Features

### GPS-Verified Clock-In/Out
- Location captured at session start and end
- Coordinates stored for audit verification
- Works on any mobile device with location services

### Session Types
- **On-site Work**: Billable hours at client locations
- **Travel Time**: Non-billable transit between sites
- **Training**: Non-billable professional development
- **Administrative**: Non-billable office work

### Automatic Hour Calculation
- Regular hours tracked automatically
- Overtime calculated based on company settings
- Daily and weekly hour totals computed in real-time

### Valid Shortfall Reasons
When technicians end sessions below daily target hours, they can provide valid reasons:
- Weather conditions
- Site access issues
- Building malfunctions
- Safety concerns
- Client-requested stop
- Equipment failure

Valid reasons don't impact performance scores but are tracked separately in analytics.

## How It Works

### For Technicians
1. Open the Time Tracking section in the Technician Portal
2. Tap "Clock In" to start your work session
3. Select the project you're working on
4. Work is automatically tracked while you're on site
5. Tap "Clock Out" when done
6. If ending early, select a shortfall reason if applicable

### For Operations Managers
1. View active workers in real-time from the dashboard
2. See who is clocked in at which project
3. Review daily and weekly hour summaries
4. Approve timesheets before payroll export

## Integration Points

- **Payroll Module**: Hours flow automatically to timesheet generation
- **Project Management**: Session data shows labor costs per project
- **Analytics**: Track billable vs non-billable hour ratios
- **Scheduling**: Compare scheduled vs actual hours worked

## Common Questions

**Q: What happens if GPS isn't available?**
A: Sessions can still be logged, but they're flagged for manual verification.

**Q: Can managers edit timesheet data?**
