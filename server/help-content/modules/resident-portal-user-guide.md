# Resident Portal User Guide

Complete guide for residents using the OnRopePro Resident Portal to view maintenance progress and communicate with service providers.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Account

To sign up for an account, go to: onrope.pro/resident

You'll need to provide:
- **Full name**
- **Email**
- **Phone number**
- **Strata plan / HOA / LMS number** - Your building's strata plan identifier
- **Unit number** - Your apartment or suite number
- **Parking stall** (optional)
- **Password** - Create a secure password for your account

**Note**: If you move to a different unit or building, you can easily update your account by changing your strata plan number and unit number. Your account stays with you.

### Entering Your Company Code

After logging in for the first time, you'll need to enter a **10-character Company Code** to complete your portal setup.

The company code:
- **Binds your account to the company** working on your building
- **Enables you to see active work** - without it, your control panel will be empty
- Is a 10-character code provided by your building manager or the service company

**Important**: Active work and building information won't appear in your control panel until you've entered the company code.

### How to Get the Company Code

Ask your building manager, strata council, or the rope access company directly. The code may also be posted in common areas during work.

A: Contact your building manager, strata council, or the rope access company directly. The 10-character code may also be posted in common areas during work.

A: You need to enter your company code first. Without it, the system doesn't know which company's projects to show you.

**Q: Can other residents see my feedback?**
