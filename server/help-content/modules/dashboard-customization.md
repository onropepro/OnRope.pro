## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have different layouts on different devices?

Your dashboard layout is saved per user account, so it will be the same whether you access the dashboard from your computer, tablet, or phone. However, the layout will automatically adjust to fit smaller screens.

### What happens if I reset my dashboard?

Clicking **Reset** will restore the default card selection and order. Any customizations you made will be lost, but you can always re-customize afterward.

### Are there cards only available to certain roles?

Yes, some cards are permission-based. For example, financial cards like **Current Pay Period** are only visible to users with financial access permissions. The card selection menu will only show cards you have permission to view.

### Can supervisors customize their own dashboards?

Each user can customize their own dashboard. Customizations are personal and do not affect other team members.
