# Scheduling and Calendar

Visual calendar system with conflict detection, time-off tracking, and resource management.

## Overview

The Scheduling module provides dual calendar views for managing crew assignments and project schedules. Automatic conflict detection prevents double-booking disasters. Time-off integration ensures you never schedule someone on vacation. Because projects and scheduling are in one system, everything stays in sync.

## Key Features

### Dual Calendar Views
- **Monthly View**: High-level project overview
- **Resource Timeline**: Employee-by-employee daily assignments

### Conflict Detection
When you try to assign someone who is already booked:
- Warning displays with details about existing assignment
- Override option available if necessary
- Cannot accidentally create double-bookings

### Time-Off Integration
- Approved vacation automatically blocks scheduling
- Employees show as unavailable in assignment panel
- Visual indicators on calendar for time-off
- Supports vacation, sick leave, personal days

### Drag-and-Drop Assignment
- Visual assignment interface
- Drag employees to projects
- Quick reschedule by moving blocks
- Color-coded by project

### Project Color Coding
- Each project gets a unique color
- Consistent colors across all views
- Easy visual identification
- Customizable per project

## How It Works

### Creating Assignments
1. Navigate to Calendar/Schedule
2. Select the project
3. Choose date range
4. Drag employees from available panel to project
5. System checks for conflicts automatically

### Managing Time-Off
1. Employee requests time-off (or manager enters directly)
2. Approve the request
3. Those dates automatically blocked for scheduling
4. Employee removed from available pool for those dates

### Resolving Conflicts
1. System alerts you to conflicts
2. View details of both assignments
3. Decide which takes priority
4. Reschedule as needed

## Problems Solved

### Monday Morning Chaos
No more 6am emergency calls because Dave was booked at two places. The system catches Friday afternoon mistakes before they become Monday disasters.

### First-Day No-Shows
Visual calendar shows all project start dates. Resource Timeline reveals if critical first days are understaffed. Protect your contract renewals.

### Vacation Booking Amnesia
Approved time-off automatically blocks scheduling. You literally cannot forget someone is on vacation.

### Scattered Tools
One system handles projects AND scheduling. Create a project and fill your calendar at the same time. No duplicate data entry.
