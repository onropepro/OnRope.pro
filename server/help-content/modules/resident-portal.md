# Resident Portal User Guide

Welcome to the OnRopePro Resident Portal. This guide gives you direct access to view maintenance work progress on your building and communicate directly with the service company. No more wondering when work will be done or whether your concerns were received.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Account

To sign up for an account, go to: [https://onrope.pro/resident](https://onrope.pro/resident)

You'll need to provide:

- **Full name**
- **Email**
- **Phone number**
- **Strata plan / HOA / LMS number** - Your building's strata plan identifier
- **Unit number** - Your apartment or suite number
- **Parking stall** (optional)
- **Password** - Create a secure password for your account

This information uniquely identifies your unit and links your account to your building.

**Note:** If you move to a different unit or building, you can easily update your account by changing your strata plan number and unit number. Your account stays with you.

### Logging In

Once your account is created, simply log in with your email and password to access the portal anytime.

### Entering Your Company Code

After logging in for the first time, you'll need to enter a **10-character Company Code** to complete your portal setup.

The company code:

- **Binds your account to the company** working on your building
- **Enables you to see active work** - without it, your control panel will be empty
- Is a 10-character code provided by your building manager or the service company

**Once you've entered the company code, you'll be able to:**

- View building progress and project updates
- See notices about upcoming work
- Submit feedback on issues (such as streaky windows, concerns, or compliments)

**Where do I get a company code?**

Your building manager or property manager can provide the company code. Usually notices will be placed in elevators or at the reception/entrance to the building.

**Important:** Active work and building information won't appear in your control panel until you've entered the company code.

Your feedback is automatically timestamped and tracked through to resolution.

**What Happens Next:**

- Your feedback receives a status: **Open**, **In Progress**, or **Closed**
- You can see the current status at any time
- The management team reviews and responds to your feedback
- You'll see updates as your feedback moves through the resolution process

**Photo Tips:** Clear photos help the team understand and resolve issues faster. Include photos showing the specific area of concern from multiple angles if possible.

### Track Your Feedback

Every piece of feedback you submit is tracked:

- **View all your submitted feedback** in one place
- **See current status** (Open, In Progress, or Closed)
- **Track response time** from submission to resolution
- **View management responses** and updates

**You'll know:**

- That your concern was received (no more wondering if anyone saw it)
- Progress on resolution
- When the issue has been addressed

![Feedback history view showing submitted feedback with status and date](/assets/help/residents-feedback-history.png)

**Note:** Once feedback is marked as "Closed," only the management team can reopen it. If you feel an issue wasn't fully resolved, submit new feedback referencing the original concern.

## Understanding Feedback Status

- **Open** - Your feedback has been submitted and is awaiting review by the management team
- **In Progress** - The team is actively working on resolving your concern
- **Closed** - The issue has been resolved and marked complete

## Key Benefits

### Transparency

No more calling the office for updates or wondering if anyone received your complaint. Everything is visible, timestamped, and tracked.

### Faster Resolution

Average resolution time drops from 3-5 days to 24 hours with the centralized feedback system.

### Visual Proof

Photo attachments provide clear evidence of issues and completed work, building trust and accountability.

### Better Communication

Direct communication channel between you and the service team eliminates the telephone game of passing messages through multiple people.

### Reduced Frustration

See real-time project progress instead of guessing when work will reach your unit. Submit concerns once and track them through to resolution.

## Managing Your Profile

Your OnRopePro account is fully portable. If you move to a new building or need to update your information, use the Profile tab in your dashboard.

![Resident Profile Tab](/assets/help/resident-profile-tab.png)

### Accessing Your Profile

1. Log in to the Resident Portal
2. Click the **Profile** tab (rightmost tab)
3. View your Personal Information and Building Information

### Updating Your Information

1. Click the **Edit** button
2. Update any of these fields:
   - **Full Name**: Your display name
   - **Phone Number**: Contact number
   - **Strata/HOA/LMS Number**: Your building's identifier
   - **Unit Number**: Your unit within the building
3. Click **Save** to confirm changes

### Moving to a New Building

If you're moving to a different building:

1. Go to the **Profile** tab
2. Update your **Strata/HOA/LMS Number** to match your new building
3. Update your **Unit Number**
4. Click **Save**

**Important**: If your new building uses a different service vendor:

1. Click **Switch** in the Vendor Connection section
2. Enter the new vendor's 10-character code
3. Your old feedback history stays with the previous building

### Switching Vendors

If your building changes service providers:

1. Go to the **Profile** tab
2. In the **Vendor Connection** section, click **Switch**
3. A dialog will appear - enter the new vendor's 10-character code
4. Click **Link Account** to confirm

Your account remains active - you're just connecting to a different service company. Your previous feedback history stays with the old vendor.

### Unlinking from a Vendor

If you no longer need to receive updates from your current vendor:

1. Go to the **Profile** tab
2. In the **Vendor Connection** section, click **Unlink**
3. A warning dialog will appear explaining the consequences
4. Click **Unlink** to confirm

**Note**: Unlinking means you won't see active projects or be able to submit feedback until you link to a vendor again. You can always re-link later by entering a new vendor code.

### Duplicate Unit Protection

If you try to register a strata/unit combination that's already registered by another resident, the system will display an error. This prevents duplicate claims to the same unit. Contact your building manager if you believe there's an error.
