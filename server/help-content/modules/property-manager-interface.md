# Property Manager Interface

Dedicated dashboard for property managers to oversee vendors and building maintenance.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I edit vendor information?**
A: No, property manager access is read-only for transparency and data integrity.

**Q: How do I add a new vendor?**

**Q: Can I see vendors' other clients?**
A: No, you only see information related to your managed buildings.

**Q: What if a vendor's CSR is low?**
A: Use this as a conversation starter; low scores indicate compliance gaps.
