# Company Safety Rating (CSR)

Quantified safety compliance score visible to property managers for vendor assessment.

## Overview

The Company Safety Rating (CSR) is a penalty-based compliance scoring system that provides an empirical measurement of your company's safety posture. Property managers can view a company's CSR score to assess vendor reliability, while company owners gain real-time visibility into their actual safety compliance. The CSR transforms safety from an unmeasured honor system into accountable, visible metrics.

## The Golden Rule

> "CSR is not just a number for property managers. It is an empirical way to build safety into your company culture."

### The CSR Formula
```
CSR Score = 100% - (Documentation Penalty + Project Docs Penalty + Harness Penalty + Document Review Penalty)
```

## Key Features

### Starting Score: 75%
New companies start at 75% and reach 100% when three core documents are uploaded:
- Certificate of Insurance (COI)
- Health and Safety Manual
- Company Policy

### Four Project Documents Tracked
For each project, the CSR monitors:
1. Anchor Inspection
2. Rope Access Plan
3. Toolbox Meeting
4. FLHA (Field Level Hazard Assessment)

### Color-Coded Badge
- **Green (90-100%)**: Excellent compliance
- **Yellow (70-89%)**: Good with room for improvement
- **Orange (50-69%)**: Needs attention
- **Red (below 50%)**: Critical compliance gaps

### Proportional Impact
Individual misses have less impact as your work history grows. A company with 100 completed projects won't be devastated by one missed form.

### Property Manager Visibility
PMs see your CSR in their vendor selection dashboard with color-coded badges. Data speaks louder than sales pitches.

### PDF Export
Generate signed document reports with timestamps for WorkSafe audits.
