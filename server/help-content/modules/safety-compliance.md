# Safety and Compliance

Digital safety documentation including harness inspections, toolbox meetings, FLHA forms, and incident reports.

## Overview

The Safety and Compliance module digitizes critical safety processes for rope access operations. From pre-work harness inspections to incident documentation, every safety requirement is captured, timestamped, and stored for regulatory compliance. This creates the audit trail that WorkSafeBC and OSHA inspectors expect.
