## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to download anything from an app store?

No. OnRopePro is a web app that you install directly from your browser. There is nothing to download from the App Store or Google Play.

### Will it use a lot of storage space?

OnRopePro uses minimal storage, typically less than 50MB. Much less than traditional mobile apps.

### Can I uninstall it later?

Yes. You can remove OnRopePro just like any other app. On mobile devices, press and hold the icon, then select Remove or Uninstall. On desktop, right-click the shortcut and delete it.

### Why does it say "Add to Home Screen" instead of "Install"?

On iOS devices, Apple uses the term "Add to Home Screen" instead of "Install." The result is the same - OnRopePro becomes an app on your device.

### The install option is not appearing. What should I do?

Make sure you are using the correct browser. On iPhone/iPad, you must use Safari. On Android, Chrome works best. On desktop, use Chrome or Edge. Also ensure you are visiting the main OnRopePro URL, not a subpage.

### Will my data sync between devices?

Yes. Since OnRopePro stores your data in the cloud, you can access the same information from any device where you are logged in.
