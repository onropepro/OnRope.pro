# Project Management

Manage all your building maintenance jobs from one central hub. Track progress, assign crews, and keep every stakeholder informed in real-time.

## What You Can Do

Project Management is the core of OnRopePro. Every job you take on becomes a project that connects your team, tracks progress, and feeds into payroll, safety documentation, and client reporting.

- **Create projects** for any building maintenance job with detailed service specifications
- **Track progress** using the method that matches your work type (drops, hours, or units)
- **Assign technicians** and manage crew schedules from a visual calendar
- **Monitor completion** with real-time updates from the field
- **Generate reports** for clients, payroll, and internal analysis

## Service Types

OnRopePro supports 10 specialized building maintenance services, plus custom job types you can create:

### Drop-Based Services (Count Vertical Passes)
- **Window Cleaning** - Track drops per elevation (N/E/S/W)
- **Building Wash / Pressure Washing** - Track drops per elevation
- **Exterior Dryer Vent Cleaning** - Track drops per elevation

### Hours-Based Services (Track Time + Completion %)
- **Painting** - Manual time tracking with completion percentage
- **Inspection** - Investigative work tracked by hours
- **General Maintenance** - Flexible time tracking

### Unit-Based Services (Count Completed Units)
- **In-Suite Dryer Vent Cleaning** - Track suites completed
- **Ground Window Cleaning** - Track suites completed
- **Gutter Cleaning** - Track suites completed
- **Parkade Pressure Cleaning** - Track parking stalls completed

## How Progress Tracking Works

When technicians end their work session, the app automatically shows the right form based on your job type:

**Drop-Based Jobs**: Technicians enter how many drops they completed on each elevation (North, East, South, West). A "drop" is one vertical pass down the building face. This gives you accurate progress data for multi-day window cleaning and exterior work.

**Hours-Based Jobs**: Technicians enter their hours worked and estimate the overall completion percentage. This works well for painting, repairs, and investigative work where progress isn't easily counted.

**Unit-Based Jobs**: Technicians enter how many units (suites or stalls) they completed. Perfect for in-suite services and parkade cleaning where you're working through a list of units.

## Creating a Project

1. Go to **Projects** in the main menu
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter the building address (autocomplete helps find the right location)
4. Select the **job type** - this determines how progress will be tracked
5. Set the **scope** (total drops, units, or estimated hours)
6. Add scheduling details and assign technicians

## Managing Active Projects

From the Projects list, you can:

- **View progress** - See completion percentage, drops/units done, and time spent
- **Assign crew** - Add or remove technicians from the project
- **Update schedule** - Change start/end dates or mark milestones
- **Add notes** - Keep track of site-specific requirements or issues
- **Link to safety docs** - Connect toolbox meetings and safety forms to the project

## Understanding the Dashboard

Your project dashboard shows:

- **Active projects** with real-time progress
- **Upcoming work** scheduled for the next 7 days
- **Completed jobs** ready for invoicing
- **Crew availability** based on current assignments

## Tips for Company Owners

- Use the **Scope** field to set expectations upfront - how many drops, units, or hours you've quoted
- Review progress against scope to catch projects that are running over
- Link projects to quotes for accurate profit tracking
- Set up project templates for recurring clients

## Tips for Operations Managers

- Use the calendar view to spot scheduling conflicts before they happen
- Check the crew assignment panel to balance workload across technicians
- Monitor daily progress reports to catch issues early
- Use the notes feature to document site access requirements

## Tips for Supervisors

- Review technician progress entries at end of day
- Verify drop counts match building scope
- Flag any safety concerns directly in the project
- Use mobile app to update progress while on-site

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I change a project's job type after creating it?
You can edit the job type from the project settings, but this will reset progress tracking. It's best to select the correct job type when creating the project.

### Can I have multiple job types on one project?
Currently, each project has one job type. For buildings that need multiple services (like window cleaning AND dryer vents), create separate projects for each service type.

### How is progress calculated for drop-based jobs?
Progress = (Total Drops Completed / Scope) x 100. For example, if you've scoped 400 total drops and completed 200, you're at 50%.

### What happens if technicians forget to log their drops?
Supervisors can edit work sessions to add missing progress entries. The system maintains an audit trail of all changes.

### Can clients see project progress?
Yes, if you're using the Resident Portal, building managers can view real-time progress on their projects. They see completion percentages and timeline updates.

### How do projects connect to payroll?
Work sessions logged against projects automatically populate the payroll system. Billable hours, overtime, and job-specific rates all flow through from project time tracking.
