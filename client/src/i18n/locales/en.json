        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What happens when I update a document?",
          "answer": "When you upload a new version, the system creates a new document that requires fresh acknowledgments from all employees. Previous signatures remain associated with the previous version. This ensures employees always acknowledge the current procedure, not an outdated version."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "Who can see my Certificate of Insurance?",
          "answer": "Only Company Owner and Ops Manager roles can view COI documents. Supervisors and Technicians cannot access these restricted financial documents. Insurance certificates contain sensitive financial information that should be limited to authorized personnel."

        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do Safe Work Practices affect my CSR?",
          "answer": "Employee acknowledgment of daily safety practice topics contributes positively to your Company Safety Rating. Consistent engagement demonstrates an active safety culture. CSR rewards companies that don't just have safety documents but actively engage employees with safety topics."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Can building managers see my documents?",
          "answer": "Building managers cannot see your actual documents. They can see your CSR score, which reflects your overall safety compliance including document acknowledgment rates. This protects your proprietary procedures while giving building managers confidence in your safety practices."

        "faq7": {
          "question": "What happens if an employee leaves?",
          "answer": "Their signature history remains in the system permanently. This maintains your audit trail even after employment ends. You can still prove that a former employee acknowledged specific procedures during their tenure."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "How does this integrate with onboarding?",
          "answer": "New employees see all required documents highlighted for acknowledgment. Onboarding checklists can include document acknowledgment milestones. New hires cannot claim they missed required procedures because the system tracks completion status."

        "faq9": {

Actual payroll calculations (CPP, EI, tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare) happen in your payroll processing software (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, etc.). OnRopePro handles time aggregation and export, not tax compliance."

          "question": "What pay period options are available?",

        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",
          "answer": "You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "What format does the export use?",
          "answer": "CSV for payroll software import. PDF for printable timesheet records. Both include employee-level detail and project attribution."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Who can see payroll data?",
          "answer": "Users with the canAccessFinancials permission. This is granted through the role-based permission system. Technicians see their own hours but not compensation rates or other employees' data."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",
          "answer": "Supervisors with appropriate permissions can review and adjust work sessions before timesheet approval. All adjustments are logged with reasons for audit purposes."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",
          "answer": "Yes. Previous pay periods remain accessible. Filter by date range to pull data from any past period."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",
          "answer": "Yes. Each work session links to a specific project. If a technician clocks into Building A for 4 hours, then Building B for 4 hours, both sessions show separately with their respective project attribution."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What about non-billable time like travel between sites?",

        },
        "faq10": {
          "question": "Is there an approval workflow before export?",
          "answer": "Yes. Timesheets can be reviewed and approved before export. Approved timesheets generate clean export files. The workflow prevents exporting data that hasn't been verified."

          "answer": "Yes. Technicians can log in using either their IRATA/SPRAT certification number or their email address. The certification number serves as a unique identifier across the platform."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens when I hire a tech who already has an OnRopePro account?",
          "answer": "Enter their IRATA/SPRAT number, send a connection request, and once they accept, their full profile transfers to your company. You only configure their compensation rate. All other information is already complete. Time required: 10 seconds (excluding their acceptance)."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Are role permissions predefined or do I have to set them up?",
          "answer": "All roles except Company Owner start with zero permissions. You must explicitly grant each permission the employee needs. This prevents accidental over-permission and allows precise matching of access to job requirements and trust level."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Does the system alert for driver's license expiration too?",
          "answer": "Yes. Driver's license expiration dates are tracked and included in the same alert system as IRATA/SPRAT certifications. Visual indicators and notifications function identically."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What happens to data when an employee is terminated?",
          "answer": "The employee loses system access immediately, but all historical data is preserved. Work sessions, safety documents, equipment assignments, and payroll history remain in the system for compliance and audit purposes. This is a soft delete, not a hard delete."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I use this for employees who aren't rope access technicians?",
          "answer": "Yes. While certification tracking is designed for rope access (IRATA/SPRAT), the module supports roles like Labourer, Ground Crew, and general support staff who may not have rope access certifications. Leave certification fields empty for non-certified staff."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "What if I suspect an employee is sharing information with competitors?",
          "answer": "Modify their permissions immediately. Remove financial access, hide client information, restrict to basic functions. No formal demotion required. Changes take effect instantly. Access modifications are logged for potential legal proceedings."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "Can employees see each other's pay rates?",
          "answer": "Only if you grant them that specific permission. Financial visibility is separated from operational access. Your supervisor can create projects and check budgets without seeing what every technician earns."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "What certifications are tracked?",
          "answer": "IRATA level and expiration, SPRAT certification, driver's license validity, and First Aid certification. All display visual status indicators (green/amber/red) and trigger 30-day warning alerts before expiration."
        },
        "q10": {
          "question": "How long does onboarding take for a completely new employee?",
          "answer": "5-10 minutes for data entry, excluding the time the employee spends setting up their own account. New employees receive login credentials via email and can then complete their profile details (emergency contacts, banking information) on their own time."
