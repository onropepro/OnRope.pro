            "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",
            "answer": "You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it."

          "faq4": {
            "question": "What format does the export use?",

            "question": "Who can see payroll data?",

            "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",

          "faq7": {
            "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",

            "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",

            "question": "What about non-billable time like travel between sites?",

            "question": "Is there an approval workflow before export?",

        "faq1": {
          "question": "Can I edit or delete a signed document acknowledgment?",
          "answer": "No. Once a document acknowledgment is signed, the signature record is permanent and cannot be modified or deleted. This creates an immutable audit trail that protects both employers and employees. Regulators require tamper-proof documentation to verify compliance."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What happens when I update a document?",
          "answer": "When you upload a new version, the system creates a new document that requires fresh acknowledgments from all employees. Previous signatures remain associated with the previous version. This ensures employees always acknowledge the current procedure, not an outdated version."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "Who can see my Certificate of Insurance?",
          "answer": "Only Company Owner and Ops Manager roles can view COI documents. Supervisors and Technicians cannot access these restricted financial documents. Insurance certificates contain sensitive financial information that should be limited to authorized personnel."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do Safe Work Practices affect my CSR?",
          "answer": "Employee acknowledgment of daily safety practice topics contributes positively to your Company Safety Rating. Consistent engagement demonstrates an active safety culture. CSR rewards companies that don't just have safety documents but actively engage employees with safety topics."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Can building managers see my documents?",
          "answer": "Building managers cannot see your actual documents. They can see your CSR score, which reflects your overall safety compliance including document acknowledgment rates. This protects your proprietary procedures while giving building managers confidence in your safety practices."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What file types are supported?",
          "answer": "PDF, DOC, and DOCX files are supported for document uploads. File type validation ensures only appropriate formats are accepted."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "What happens if an employee leaves?",
          "answer": "Their signature history remains in the system permanently. This maintains your audit trail even after employment ends. You can still prove that a former employee acknowledged specific procedures during their tenure."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "How does this integrate with onboarding?",
          "answer": "New employees see all required documents highlighted for acknowledgment. Onboarding checklists can include document acknowledgment milestones. New hires cannot claim they missed required procedures because the system tracks completion status."

        "faq9": {
          "question": "Can employees sign from mobile devices?",

        "a1": "New companies start at 75%. Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100%. From there, penalties are applied based on ongoing compliance gaps.",
        "q2": "What if I add Safe Work Procedures and my score drops?",
        "a2": "This is intentional. When you add new safety documents, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign them. This ensures documents aren't just uploaded and forgotten. Once all employees acknowledge the new procedures, your score returns to full compliance.",
        "q3": "How do harness inspection penalties work?",
        "a3": "The penalty is calculated as a percentage of missed inspections against total work sessions. If you have 1,000 work sessions and miss 10 inspections, that's a 1% penalty. If you're just starting and have 10 sessions with 5 missed inspections, that's a 50% penalty in this category. Consistent compliance over time builds a resilient score.",
        "q4": "Can technicians see my CSR before accepting job offers?",
        "a4": "Yes. Technicians evaluating potential employers can see company CSR ratings. This allows them to make informed decisions about safety before committing to a position.",
        "q5": "What do property managers see?",
        "a5": "Property managers see your overall CSR percentage and a color-coded badge (green, yellow, orange, or red) through their vendor dashboard. They can also see category breakdowns but not your internal operational details.",
        "q6": "Who cannot see my CSR?",
        "a6": "Building managers and residents. Building managers handle on-site logistics (keys, water, parking) and don't make vendor selection decisions. Residents seeing safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns without appropriate context.",
        "q7": "What documents are required for each project?",
        "a7": "Four documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing any of these for a project contributes to your project documents penalty.",
        "q8": "Can my score ever reach 100% again after adding employees or documents?",
        "a8": "Yes. 100% is achievable when all company documents are current, all projects have complete documentation, all work sessions have associated harness inspections, and all employees have signed all required documents. The system is designed so perfect scores are difficult to maintain long-term, reflecting that nobody is 100% safe forever.",
        "q9": "How quickly does the score update?",
        "a9": "Real-time. When a technician completes a harness inspection, when an employee signs a document, when a toolbox meeting is logged, the score recalculates immediately.",
        "q10": "What if a new employee joins and hasn't signed anything yet?",
        "a10": "Your score will decrease proportionally until they complete onboarding documentation. This incentivizes prompt completion of new employee safety training and document acknowledgments.",
        "q11": "Can I export CSR data for insurance or regulatory purposes?",
        "a11": "Yes. Generate PDF reports showing employee signatures with timestamps for all safety documents, harness inspection completion records, and toolbox meeting logs. These exports satisfy insurance auditors, WorkSafe inspectors, and IRATA/SPRAT compliance requirements.",
        "q12": "Is the CSR visible to competitors?",
        "a12": "No. Only your own company owners, your technicians (when evaluating job offers), and property managers (when viewing their vendor list) can see your score. Competitors cannot access your CSR."

          "question": "Does white-label branding affect any module functionality?",
          "answer": "No. Branding changes only visual elements (logos, colors, PDF headers). All OnRopePro capabilities, workflows, and integrations function identically regardless of branding status. Your team's operational processes remain unchanged."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "Can I preview branding changes before applying them to the live platform?",
          "answer": "Not currently. Logo uploads and color selections apply immediately platform-wide. Best practice: Update branding during off-peak hours (evenings, weekends) when fewer employees and clients actively use the system. Most companies finalize branding within 2-3 adjustment attempts."

        "faq3": {
          "question": "What happens to our branding if our subscription expires?",
          "answer": "The system automatically reverts to OnRopePro default branding immediately upon subscription expiration. You receive three warning notifications (30 days, 7 days, 1 day before expiration) to prevent surprise changes. Reactivate your subscription to restore branded experience instantly."

        "faq4": {
          "question": "Will clients know we're using OnRopePro?",
          "answer": "Client-facing elements display only your branding. OnRopePro attribution appears only in footer copyright notices (industry standard for white-label platforms). Building managers, property managers, and residents interact exclusively with your branded experience throughout portals, notifications, and documentation."

        "faq5": {
          "question": "Can we use custom domain names like portal.ourcompany.com?",

        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "How long does it take to set up white-label branding?",
          "answer": "Complete setup requires under 10 minutes: subscribe to Professional plan or higher (2 minutes), upload company logo (1 minute), select two brand colors (2 minutes), verify appearance across sample interfaces (5 minutes). Branding activates instantly after configuration."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "What file formats do you support for logo uploads?",
          "answer": "PNG and JPG formats only. Recommended dimensions: 300x100 pixels minimum for clear display across headers and mobile interfaces. Maximum file size: 2MB. The system rejects uploads that don't meet format or size requirements."

          "question": "Can multiple people in our company manage branding settings?",
          "answer": "Only users with Owner or Admin permissions can access branding settings. This permission restriction prevents unauthorized branding changes by project supervisors or technicians. Grant Admin permissions to your operations manager or marketing team member if you want them to manage branding independently."

          "question": "Is there a limit to how many times we can change our branding?",

        "faq1": {
          "question": "Does OnRopePro calculate my taxes and deductions?",
          "answer": "No. OnRopePro prepares payroll-ready timesheet data for export. Actual payroll calculations (CPP, EI, tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare) happen in your payroll processing software (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, etc.). OnRopePro handles time aggregation and export, not tax compliance."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What pay period options are available?",
          "answer": "Weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly. The system generates period boundaries automatically based on your selection."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",
          "answer": "You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "What format does the export use?",
          "answer": "CSV for payroll software import. PDF for printable timesheet records. Both include employee-level detail and project attribution."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Who can see payroll data?",
          "answer": "Users with the canAccessFinancials permission. This is granted through the role-based permission system. Technicians see their own hours but not compensation rates or other employees' data."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",
          "answer": "Supervisors with appropriate permissions can review and adjust work sessions before timesheet approval. All adjustments are logged with reasons for audit purposes."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",
          "answer": "Yes. Previous pay periods remain accessible. Filter by date range to pull data from any past period."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",
          "answer": "Yes. Each work session links to a specific project. If a technician clocks into Building A for 4 hours, then Building B for 4 hours, both sessions show separately with their respective project attribution."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What about non-billable time like travel between sites?",
          "answer": "Non-billable work sessions track hours that cannot be charged to clients (travel, training, equipment maintenance, weather delays). The payroll view shows both billable and non-billable hours so you know your true labor cost."
        },
        "faq10": {
          "question": "Is there an approval workflow before export?",
          "answer": "Yes. Timesheets can be reviewed and approved before export. Approved timesheets generate clean export files. The workflow prevents exporting data that hasn't been verified."

          "question": "Can technicians login with their IRATA number instead of email?",
          "answer": "Yes. Technicians can log in using either their IRATA/SPRAT certification number or their email address. The certification number serves as a unique identifier across the platform."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens when I hire a tech who already has an OnRopePro account?",
          "answer": "Enter their IRATA/SPRAT number, send a connection request, and once they accept, their full profile transfers to your company. You only configure their compensation rate. All other information is already complete. Time required: 10 seconds (excluding their acceptance)."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Are role permissions predefined or do I have to set them up?",
          "answer": "All roles except Company Owner start with zero permissions. You must explicitly grant each permission the employee needs. This prevents accidental over-permission and allows precise matching of access to job requirements and trust level."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Does the system alert for driver's license expiration too?",
          "answer": "Yes. Driver's license expiration dates are tracked and included in the same alert system as IRATA/SPRAT certifications. Visual indicators and notifications function identically."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What happens to data when an employee is terminated?",
          "answer": "The employee loses system access immediately, but all historical data is preserved. Work sessions, safety documents, equipment assignments, and payroll history remain in the system for compliance and audit purposes. This is a soft delete, not a hard delete."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "Can I use this for employees who aren't rope access technicians?",
          "answer": "Yes. While certification tracking is designed for rope access (IRATA/SPRAT), the module supports roles like Labourer, Ground Crew, and general support staff who may not have rope access certifications. Leave certification fields empty for non-certified staff."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "What if I suspect an employee is sharing information with competitors?",
          "answer": "Modify their permissions immediately. Remove financial access, hide client information, restrict to basic functions. No formal demotion required. Changes take effect instantly. Access modifications are logged for potential legal proceedings."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "Can employees see each other's pay rates?",
          "answer": "Only if you grant them that specific permission. Financial visibility is separated from operational access. Your supervisor can create projects and check budgets without seeing what every technician earns."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "What certifications are tracked?",
          "answer": "IRATA level and expiration, SPRAT certification, driver's license validity, and First Aid certification. All display visual status indicators (green/amber/red) and trigger 30-day warning alerts before expiration."
        },
        "q10": {
          "question": "How long does onboarding take for a completely new employee?",
          "answer": "5-10 minutes for data entry, excluding the time the employee spends setting up their own account. New employees receive login credentials via email and can then complete their profile details (emergency contacts, banking information) on their own time."

          "question": "Does this replace my physical IRATA/SPRAT logbook?",
          "answer": "No. IRATA and SPRAT still require physical logbooks. WorkSafeBC and other regulatory bodies may request to see your written records on-site. OnRopePro is a digital supplement that helps you maintain accurate records, never lose your hour history, and have a reliable backup for your paper logbook."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What happens to my hours if I change employers?",
          "answer": "Your IRATA/SPRAT hours belong to your technician profile, not your employer. When you move to a new company, your complete hour history comes with you automatically. No re-entry required."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "Can I log hours if I'm not connected to an employer on the platform?",
          "answer": "Yes. Independent technicians can manually log their hours and tasks. You can also scan your existing paper logbook to import historical data."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do I log training hours from external courses?",
          "answer": "Training at IRATA/SPRAT schools counts as rope time. Use the manual entry feature to add training hours, specifying the training provider and skills practiced."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "What's the difference between shift hours and task hours?",
          "answer": "Shift hours are your total time at work. Task hours are the actual time performing rope access activities. An 8-hour shift might only include 6-7 hours of actual rope work after breaks, travel, and ground prep. The system prompts you to specify how many of your shift hours were actual task hours."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What if my employer doesn't use OnRopePro?",
          "answer": "You can still create a technician account and log hours manually. When your employer eventually joins the platform (or you move to an employer who uses it), your existing hour history integrates automatically."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "Can Level 3s approve hours digitally?",
          "answer": "Digital signature and approval flow is planned for future release (pending us contacting IRATA and SPRAT). Currently, hours log to your profile without supervisor sign-off. Once IRATA formally approves digital logging, the approval workflow will activate."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "What if I have no logged rope time for 6 months?",
          "answer": "IRATA may consider your certification invalid until recertification if you have no logged rope time for 6 months. Consistent logging through OnRopePro ensures you never have unexplained gaps that could jeopardize your credentials."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "Is this a Plus feature or standard?",
          "answer": "Logbook scanning and basic hour logging are available to all technician accounts. Certification progress tracking (hours remaining to next level) requires Plus."

        "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about the Company Safety Rating.",
        "q1": "How is the starting score calculated?",
        "a1": "New companies start at 75%. Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100%. From there, penalties are applied based on ongoing compliance gaps.",
        "q2": "What if I add Safe Work Procedures and my score drops?",
        "a2": "This is intentional. When you add new safety documents, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign them. This ensures documents aren't just uploaded and forgotten. Once all employees acknowledge the new procedures, your score returns to full compliance.",
        "q3": "How do harness inspection penalties work?",
        "a3": "The penalty is calculated as a percentage of missed inspections against total work sessions. If you have 1,000 work sessions and miss 10 inspections, that's a 1% penalty. If you're just starting and have 10 sessions with 5 missed inspections, that's a 50% penalty in this category. Consistent compliance over time builds a resilient score.",
        "q4": "Can technicians see my CSR before accepting job offers?",
        "a4": "Yes. Technicians evaluating potential employers can see company CSR ratings. This allows them to make informed decisions about safety before committing to a position.",
        "q5": "What do property managers see?",
        "a5": "Property managers see your overall CSR percentage and a color-coded badge (green, yellow, orange, or red) through their vendor dashboard. They can also see category breakdowns but not your internal operational details.",
        "q6": "Who cannot see my CSR?",
        "a6": "Building managers and residents. Building managers handle on-site logistics (keys, water, parking) and don't make vendor selection decisions. Residents seeing safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns without appropriate context.",
        "q7": "What documents are required for each project?",
        "a7": "Four documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing any of these for a project contributes to your project documents penalty.",
        "q8": "Can my score ever reach 100% again after adding employees or documents?",
        "a8": "Yes. 100% is achievable when all company documents are current, all projects have complete documentation, all work sessions have associated harness inspections, and all employees have signed all required documents. The system is designed so perfect scores are difficult to maintain long-term, reflecting that nobody is 100% safe forever.",
        "q9": "How quickly does the score update?",
        "a9": "Real-time. When a technician completes a harness inspection, when an employee signs a document, when a toolbox meeting is logged, the score recalculates immediately.",
        "q10": "What if a new employee joins and hasn't signed anything yet?",
        "a10": "Your score will decrease proportionally until they complete onboarding documentation. This incentivizes prompt completion of new employee safety training and document acknowledgments.",
        "q11": "Can I export CSR data for insurance or regulatory purposes?",
        "a11": "Yes. Generate PDF reports showing employee signatures with timestamps for all safety documents, harness inspection completion records, and toolbox meeting logs. These exports satisfy insurance auditors, WorkSafe inspectors, and IRATA/SPRAT compliance requirements.",
        "q12": "Is the CSR visible to competitors?",
        "a12": "No. Only your own company owners, your technicians (when evaluating job offers), and property managers (when viewing their vendor list) can see your score. Competitors cannot access your CSR."

          "question": "What's the difference between internal notes and visible replies?",
          "answer": "Internal notes are private (staff only) for coordination, investigation findings, and sensitive discussions. Visible replies are seen by the resident for acknowledgment, status updates, and resolution communication. Staff must explicitly toggle a yellow/red checkbox to make a reply visible, preventing accidental exposure."

          "question": "Is sensitive data secure?",

        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What happens when a tech leaves my company?",
          "answer": "Their Passport (certifications, work history, safety rating) stays with them. Your company retains records of work they completed while connected. Clean separation for both sides."

          "question": "Can I require techs to use OnRopePro?",

          "question": "What happens when a building manager leaves?",

        "faq3": {
          "question": "Can technicians see each other's pay rates?",

        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do residents get access to the portal?",
          "answer": "Building codes. The code appears on elevator notices, gets shared by technicians on-site, or sent by property managers. Resident enters the code, creates an account, instant access to their building's portal."

          "question": "What if a resident accidentally registers for the wrong unit?",
          "answer": "The system prompts: \"There's already an account for this unit. Are you a new resident?\" If they confirm, access transfers. If they realize the mistake, they go back and enter the correct unit."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "Can building managers see financial information?",
          "answer": "No. Building manager accounts have read-only access to project progress, feedback status, and work history. They cannot see rates, costs, or internal financial data."

          "question": "How does feedback tracking work?",
          "answer": "Every submission timestamps automatically: when it was opened, when it was acknowledged, when it was resolved. The system calculates average response time and generates exportable reports for strata councils or property managers."

        "faq8": {
          "question": "Is my company's data separated from other OnRopePro customers?",

        "a1": "Technicians log drops completed per elevation at the end of each work session. The system asks for North, East, South, and West counts separately. Progress calculates automatically based on target drops per direction. Visual progress bars show completion by elevation.",
        "q2": "Can building managers see everything we see?",
        "a2": "Building managers see project progress, schedules, photo galleries, and safety documentation. They don't see internal performance metrics, piece work rates, or employee-specific data you'd rather keep private.",
        "q3": "What happens if we work on all four elevations simultaneously?",
        "a3": "Each technician logs drops for whichever elevation they worked. If Tommy worked North and Sarah worked East, their sessions record to their respective elevations. Total project progress combines all four automatically.",
        "q4": "Can we use our own job types?",
        "a4": "Yes. Create custom job types with your own names and tracking methods. Choose drop-based, hours-based, or unit-based tracking. Custom types save permanently and become available for all future projects.",
        "q5": "How does piece work pay calculate?",
        "a5": "Enable piece work mode on drop-based projects. Set the rate per drop. When a technician logs 20 drops at $8 per drop, the system calculates $160 for that session. The payroll module pulls this automatically. Technicians see exactly how their pay was calculated.",
        "q6": "What if a project gets delayed by weather?",
        "a6": "Put the project on hold with one click. Calendar entries update automatically. When weather clears, reactivate the project and adjust dates. Building manager portal shows the updated schedule. No need to send multiple update emails.",
        "q7": "Can technicians see their performance compared to others?",
        "a7": "Technicians see their own performance metrics and trends. They don't see other technicians' data. Owners and supervisors see company-wide performance comparisons to identify coaching opportunities.",
        "q8": "How do I know if a project is falling behind?",
        "a8": "The dashboard shows expected completion versus current pace. If a project is behind target, visual indicators flag it before clients notice. You can adjust crew assignments or extend timelines proactively.",
        "q9": "What happens to completed projects?",
        "a9": "Completed projects archive automatically but remain searchable. Historical data powers accurate future quoting. Building managers can still access project records for compliance verification. Nothing gets deleted unless you explicitly choose to.",
        "q10": "Does the calendar sync with Google Calendar or Outlook?",
        "a10": "The OnRopePro calendar is the source of truth. We're evaluating external calendar sync for future development. For now, the system ensures all internal stakeholders see the same schedule without needing external tools."

        "a3": "GPS accuracy depends on device and conditions. Configurable tolerance radius accounts for signal variation. Indoor locations can use site check-in instead.",
        "q4": "Can I set different overtime rules?",
        "a4": "Yes. Configure daily thresholds, weekly thresholds, or both. Different rules for different employee classifications if needed.",
        "q5": "Does it work without internet?",
        "a5": "Yes. Offline mode captures clock events locally and syncs when connectivity returns. No lost entries.",
        "q6": "Can supervisors edit time entries?",
        "a6": "Yes, with full audit trail. All edits are logged with who made them, when, and what was changed. Original data preserved.",
        "q7": "How does break tracking work?",
        "a7": "Configurable rules for automatic deduction or manual break logging. Comply with your jurisdiction's break requirements.",
        "q8": "Can I export to my payroll system?",
        "a8": "CSV exports formatted for common payroll systems. Custom export templates available for specific requirements.",
        "q9": "What about piece work tracking?",
        "a9": "Log drops, units, or other piece work metrics alongside time. System calculates piece work pay based on configured rates.",
        "q10": "Is there a time clock kiosk option?",

        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens if I try to assign someone who's on vacation?",
          "answer": "The system displays a conflict warning showing the approved time-off dates. You see the warning before the assignment is created. You can override if necessary, but you cannot accidentally schedule someone during approved vacation."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can I still make scheduling decisions if there's a conflict?",
          "answer": "Yes. Conflict warnings display details and give you the option to proceed or cancel. The system prevents accidents, not decisions. You remain in control."

          "question": "How does the calendar connect to projects?",

          "answer": "10 leave types: vacation, sick leave, personal leave, bereavement, jury duty, medical leave, family emergency, unpaid leave, training/development, and military leave. Each displays distinctly on the calendar."

          "question": "Can I see both projects and employees in one view?",

        "faq1": {
          "question": "Can technicians really not see my pricing?",
          "answer": "Correct. Financial Access permission controls pricing visibility at the field level. Technicians without this permission see the building data entry form without any pricing fields appearing. They cannot see rates, totals, or historical pricing data."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What happens when a technician creates a quote but can't add pricing?",
          "answer": "They complete the site assessment portion - building address, drop counts per elevation, photos, service selections. Quote saves as Draft. You or authorized personnel then open the quote, add pricing using your configured rates, and move to Submitted stage."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "How do the pricing formulas work for different services?",
          "answer": "Each service type has its own calculation logic. Window cleaning: drops divided by daily target multiplied by hours per day multiplied by hourly rate. Parkade: stall count multiplied by per-stall rate. Custom services allow manual hour entry. Formulas match how you actually price jobs."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "Can I quote multiple buildings in one quote?",
          "answer": "Yes. Multi-building support handles complexes with Tower A, Tower B, Tower C configurations. Each tower has separate floor counts, drop counts, and calculations. Total quote combines all towers. When converted to project, work sessions let technicians select which tower they are working on. Resident portal shows tower-specific updates."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Do quotes automatically email to clients?",
          "answer": "Currently no. Quote PDFs download to your device, then you email from your own email address. Future update will enable direct sending from vendor@yourcompany.com with proper DNS configuration. Download approach ensures quotes come from your recognized email address."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What if my pricing model does not match the built-in formulas?",
          "answer": "Custom service type allows completely configurable pricing. Define your own calculation variables, labor multipliers, and service fee structures. If you need a specific formula added as a standard service type, contact support. Formula requests from multiple vendors get prioritized for system-wide implementation."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "How does tax calculation work?",
          "answer": "Tax configuration will be based on building address (province/state determines rate). System calculates applicable taxes automatically. Currently being implemented. You can enter taxes manually in the interim. Future update will support dual-tax jurisdictions (GST + PST scenarios) with override capabilities for edge cases."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "Can I edit quotes after they are in \"Submitted\" or \"Under Review\"?",
          "answer": "Yes. Drag quote back to Draft stage, make edits, then move forward again. Edit history tracks changes for internal audit trail. Property manager only sees current version. You cannot edit quotes in Won stage (convert to project instead). Lost quotes archive for historical reference."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What permissions do operations managers need to create quotes?",
          "answer": "Create Quotes permission enables quote creation. Financial Access permission determines if they see pricing fields. You can grant quote creation without financial visibility. They assess buildings, create scopes, move quotes through pipeline. You review and add final pricing before client delivery."
        },
        "faq10": {
          "question": "How do quotes convert to projects?",
          "answer": "Won quote stage includes \"Convert to Project\" button. Click button. System creates new project with building address, service details, budget hours, client contacts, tower configurations, pricing data. Quote remains in Won stage for reference. Project links back to original quote for historical context."
        },
        "faq11": {
          "question": "Can I track win/loss reasons for pipeline analytics?",
          "answer": "Yes. When marking quote as Lost, you categorize reason (price too high, chose competitor, timeline did not work, etc.). Analytics track loss reasons over time. Identify patterns like \"losing 60% of quotes to faster competitors\" or \"price objections on parkade services.\" Data informs pricing strategy and process improvements."
        },
        "faq12": {
          "question": "Do building photos increase quote file size?",
          "answer": "Photos compress automatically for system storage. Original quality preserved for reference viewing. Quote PDFs include photos at print-appropriate resolution without creating massive file sizes. Download speeds stay fast even with multiple elevation photos attached."
        },
        "faq13": {
          "question": "What happens if property manager requests changes to accepted quote?",
          "answer": "Depends on change scope. Minor adjustments (different dates, tower sequence) you can note in project details. Significant changes (added buildings, different services) create new quote version as change order. Original quote stays in Won stage. New quote references original for audit trail."
        },
        "faq14": {
          "question": "Can I duplicate quotes for similar buildings?",
          "answer": "Yes. \"Duplicate Quote\" function copies building template with service selections and configurations. You update building-specific details (address, drop counts, elevations). Pricing models stay identical. Useful for annual renewals or similar complexes in same area. Saves 80% of quote setup time."
        },
        "faq15": {
          "question": "How long does pipeline data persist?",
          "answer": "Forever. Won and Lost quotes archive with full historical data. Reference last year's pricing when client requests renewal. Track win rates over multi-year periods. Building associations preserve maintenance history across ownership changes. Data belongs to your company permanently."

You add it to the mental list of things that need attention. Multiply that by 50 buildings during busy season and you're drowning in administrative work that produces nothing.",
        "paragraph2": "The notebook Tommy used to track complaints still has pages with chicken scratch from phone calls taken while driving. The Google Form helped but created a new problem: sorting 30 submissions from 5 different buildings, then calling each resident individually. The complaint management \"system\" was whatever got written down that day.",
        "paragraph3": "With the Resident Portal, feedback organizes itself.",
        "paragraph4": "By building. By project. With photos attached. With timestamps proving when it was seen. With resolution metrics calculating automatically. The chaos becomes a dashboard.

        "q1": {
          "question": "Can residents see other residents' complaints?",
          "answer": "No. Residents can only view and interact with their own feedback submissions. Privacy is protected by design."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens when a resident moves to a different building?",
          "answer": "They update their Strata/LMS number in their profile and enter the new vendor's code. Their account is fully portable. If the new building's vendor uses OnRopePro, they see that vendor's projects. If not, they notice the gap."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can residents reopen closed feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Only company staff can reopen closed feedback. If a resident believes the issue persists, they contact their property manager or building manager directly. This prevents endless back-and-forth on resolved issues."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can property managers respond to resident feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Property managers can view all feedback and communication history but cannot respond. Only company staff communicate with residents through the system. This keeps property managers informed without requiring their involvement."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What's the difference between internal notes and visible replies?",
          "answer": "Internal notes are private (staff only) for coordination, investigation findings, and sensitive discussions. Visible replies are seen by the resident for acknowledgment, status updates, and resolution communication. Staff must explicitly toggle a yellow/red checkbox to make a reply visible, preventing accidental exposure."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How do residents get the vendor code?",
          "answer": "The code is posted on notices in the elevator during projects, provided by the building manager, or included in project communications. One code per company, used for all buildings that company services."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "Is there one code per building or one code per company?",
          "answer": "One code per company. All residents across all buildings serviced by that company use the same vendor code. The Strata/LMS number differentiates which building's projects they see."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "How long do residents have to submit feedback after a project completes?",
          "answer": "5 business days. This allows time for residents to notice issues while limiting the complaint window to a reasonable period."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "What happens if feedback sits unread?",
          "answer": "Notification badges show pending items in your dashboard. The \"Viewed\" timestamp is visible to the resident, so they know if no one has opened their feedback. This creates natural accountability."
        },
        "q10": {
          "question": "Do residents see when we add internal notes?",
          "answer": "No. Internal notes are completely invisible to residents. They only see visible replies and status changes."

        "q1": "How is the starting score calculated?",
        "a1": "New companies start at 75%. Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100%. From there, penalties are applied based on ongoing compliance gaps.",
        "q2": "What if I add Safe Work Procedures and my score drops?",
        "a2": "This is intentional. When you add new safety documents, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign them. This ensures documents aren't just uploaded and forgotten. Once all employees acknowledge the new procedures, your score returns to full compliance.",
        "q3": "How do harness inspection penalties work?",
        "a3": "The penalty is calculated as a percentage of missed inspections against total work sessions. If you have 1,000 work sessions and miss 10 inspections, that's a 1% penalty. If you're just starting and have 10 sessions with 5 missed inspections, that's a 50% penalty in this category. Consistent compliance over time builds a resilient score.",
        "q4": "Can technicians see my CSR before accepting job offers?",
        "a4": "Yes. Technicians evaluating potential employers can see company CSR ratings. This allows them to make informed decisions about safety before committing to a position.",
        "q5": "What do property managers see?",
        "a5": "Property managers see your overall CSR percentage and a color-coded badge (green, yellow, orange, or red) through their vendor dashboard. They can also see category breakdowns but not your internal operational details.",
        "q6": "Who cannot see my CSR?",
        "a6": "Building managers and residents. Building managers handle on-site logistics (keys, water, parking) and don't make vendor selection decisions. Residents seeing safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns without appropriate context.",
        "q7": "What documents are required for each project?",
        "a7": "Four documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing any of these for a project contributes to your project documents penalty.",
        "q8": "Can my score ever reach 100% again after adding employees or documents?",
        "a8": "Yes. 100% is achievable when all company documents are current, all projects have complete documentation, all work sessions have associated harness inspections, and all employees have signed all required documents. The system is designed so perfect scores are difficult to maintain long-term, reflecting that nobody is 100% safe forever.",
        "q9": "How quickly does the score update?",
        "a9": "Real-time. When a technician completes a harness inspection, when an employee signs a document, when a toolbox meeting is logged, the score recalculates immediately.",
        "q10": "What if a new employee joins and hasn't signed anything yet?",
        "a10": "Your score will decrease proportionally until they complete onboarding documentation. This incentivizes prompt completion of new employee safety training and document acknowledgments.",
        "q11": "Can I export CSR data for insurance or regulatory purposes?",
        "a11": "Yes. Generate PDF reports showing employee signatures with timestamps for all safety documents, harness inspection completion records, and toolbox meeting logs. These exports satisfy insurance auditors, WorkSafe inspectors, and IRATA/SPRAT compliance requirements.",
        "q12": "Is the CSR visible to competitors?",

        "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about the Quoting & Sales Pipeline module.",
        "q1": "How do technicians create quotes without seeing pricing?",
        "a1": "Financial Access permission controls pricing visibility. Users without this permission see quote forms with building data fields only. Drop counts, elevations, photos, notes—but no rate fields or totals. They submit complete site assessments that users with Financial Access then price.",
        "q2": "How do the service-specific pricing formulas work?",
        "a2": "Each service type has its own calculation method. Window cleaning: total drops ÷ daily productivity target = estimated hours. Parkade cleaning: stall count × rate = total. Caulking: linear feet × rate. You configure your own productivity targets and rates. The system calculates automatically.",
        "q3": "Can I customize the quote PDF layout?",
        "a3": "Quote PDFs include your company logo, itemized service breakdown, tower specifications, and total pricing. The format is standardized for professional appearance. Custom branding beyond logo placement is not currently available.",
        "q4": "How does the Kanban pipeline work?",
        "a4": "Quotes appear as cards in columns: Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Negotiation, Won, Lost. Drag cards between columns to update status. Click any card to view full quote details. Filter by date range, service type, or building.",
        "q5": "What happens when I convert a won quote to a project?",
        "a5": "Click \"Convert to Project\" on a Won quote. Building address, tower configurations, service specifications, budget hours, and client contacts transfer automatically. The new project links back to the original quote for reference.",
        "q6": "Can technicians take photos during site assessment?",
        "a6": "Yes. The mobile quote form includes photo upload for each elevation. Photos attach to the quote and appear in the PDF export. Use photos to verify access points, document complications, and support accurate pricing.",
        "q7": "How do multi-building quotes work?",
        "a7": "Add multiple towers within a single quote. Each tower has separate floor counts, drop counts per elevation, and service specifications. Quote total aggregates all towers. Work sessions later allow technicians to select which tower they're working on.",
        "q8": "Can I see quote history for a building?",
        "a8": "Yes. Buildings maintain quote history. View all quotes ever created for a specific address. Compare year-over-year pricing. Reference previous scope when creating new quotes.",
        "q9": "How do I track win rates?",
        "a9": "Pipeline analytics show quotes won vs. lost over time. Filter by service type, building size, or date range. Identify patterns in what you win and lose.",
        "q10": "Can multiple people work on the same quote?",
        "a10": "Yes. Technician creates initial assessment. Office manager reviews and adds client contacts. Owner adds pricing and approves for sending. Each user sees only the fields their permissions allow.",
        "q11": "How fast can I send a quote after site assessment?",
        "a11": "If technician completes mobile assessment and you have pricing ready, you can generate and send PDF within minutes of their submission. Same-day quoting becomes standard practice.",
        "q12": "What if I need to revise a submitted quote?",
        "a12": "Create a new version from the existing quote. Previous version is preserved for audit trail. Send the updated version to the client. Quote history shows all versions.",
        "q13": "Can building managers see our quotes directly?",
        "a13": "You control quote delivery. Export PDF and email it, or send directly through the system. Building managers see only what you explicitly share. Internal draft quotes remain private.",
        "q14": "How does this integrate with project management?",
        "a14": "Won quotes convert to projects. Budget hours from the quote become project budget. Actual hours tracked during work sessions compare against quoted estimate. You see if jobs ran over or under budget.",
        "q15": "Is there quote approval workflow?",
        "a15": "Permission controls determine who can move quotes to Submitted status. Configure so only owners or managers can finalize and send quotes. Technicians create drafts that require approval."

          "question": "Can residents see other residents' complaints?",
          "answer": "No. Residents can only view and interact with their own feedback submissions. Privacy is protected by design."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens when a resident moves to a different building?",
          "answer": "They update their Strata/LMS number in their profile and enter the new vendor's code. Their account is fully portable. If the new building's vendor uses OnRopePro, they see that vendor's projects. If not, they notice the gap."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can residents reopen closed feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Only company staff can reopen closed feedback. If a resident believes the issue persists, they contact their property manager or building manager directly. This prevents endless back-and-forth on resolved issues."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can property managers respond to resident feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Property managers can view all feedback and communication history but cannot respond. Only company staff communicate with residents through the system. This keeps property managers informed without requiring their involvement."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What's the difference between internal notes and visible replies?",
          "answer": "Internal notes are private (staff only) for coordination, investigation findings, and sensitive discussions. Visible replies are seen by the resident for acknowledgment, status updates, and resolution communication. Staff must explicitly toggle a yellow/red checkbox to make a reply visible, preventing accidental exposure."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How do residents get the vendor code?",
          "answer": "The code is posted on notices in the elevator during projects, provided by the building manager, or included in project communications. One code per company, used for all buildings that company services."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "Is there one code per building or one code per company?",
          "answer": "One code per company. All residents across all buildings serviced by that company use the same vendor code. The Strata/LMS number differentiates which building's projects they see."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "How long do residents have to submit feedback after a project completes?",
          "answer": "5 business days. This allows time for residents to notice issues while limiting the complaint window to a reasonable period."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "What happens if feedback sits unread?",
          "answer": "Notification badges show pending items in your dashboard. The \"Viewed\" timestamp is visible to the resident, so they know if no one has opened their feedback. This creates natural accountability."
        },
        "q10": {
          "question": "Do residents see when we add internal notes?",
          "answer": "No. Internal notes are completely invisible to residents. They only see visible replies and status changes."

          "question": "What happens when a building manager leaves?",
          "answer": "Buildings have accounts, not building managers. The new manager changes the building password. Access transfers instantly. The former manager is locked out. No vendor coordination required."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "Can technicians see each other's pay rates?",
          "answer": "Only if you grant financial permissions, which you control individually per employee. By default, technicians see only their own work records and assigned projects."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do residents get access to the portal?",
          "answer": "Building codes. The code appears on elevator notices, gets shared by technicians on-site, or sent by property managers. Resident enters the code, creates an account, instant access to their building's portal."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "What if a resident accidentally registers for the wrong unit?",
          "answer": "The system prompts: \"There's already an account for this unit. Are you a new resident?\" If they confirm, access transfers. If they realize the mistake, they go back and enter the correct unit."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "Can building managers see financial information?",
          "answer": "No. Building manager accounts have read-only access to project progress, feedback status, and work history. They cannot see rates, costs, or internal financial data."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "How does feedback tracking work?",
          "answer": "Every submission timestamps automatically: when it was opened, when it was acknowledged, when it was resolved. The system calculates average response time and generates exportable reports for strata councils or property managers."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "Is my company's data separated from other OnRopePro customers?",
          "answer": "Completely. Multi-tenant architecture means your data exists in a separate partition. Every query, every API call filters to your company only. A security issue with another account cannot expose your information."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What permissions are available?",
          "answer": "44+ individual permissions across categories: financial (rates, costs, margins), operational (projects, scheduling), safety (inspections, documentation), inventory (equipment, consumables), and employee management (hiring, roles)."
        },
        "faq10": {
          "question": "Can I create custom roles?",
          "answer": "Yes. While the system includes standard roles (Operations Manager, Supervisor, Technician, etc.), you can create custom positions for unique needs like Inventory Manager or Safety Officer, then assign whatever permissions that role requires."

        "faq1": {
          "question": "Does OnRopePro calculate my taxes and deductions?",
          "answer": "No. OnRopePro prepares payroll-ready timesheet data for export. Actual payroll calculations (CPP, EI, tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare) happen in your payroll processing software (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, etc.). OnRopePro handles time aggregation and export, not tax compliance."
        },
        "faq2": {
          "question": "What pay period options are available?",
          "answer": "Weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly. The system generates period boundaries automatically based on your selection."
        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",
          "answer": "You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "What format does the export use?",
          "answer": "CSV for payroll software import. PDF for printable timesheet records. Both include employee-level detail and project attribution."
        },
        "faq5": {
          "question": "Who can see payroll data?",
          "answer": "Users with the canAccessFinancials permission. This is granted through the role-based permission system. Technicians see their own hours but not compensation rates or other employees' data."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",
          "answer": "Supervisors with appropriate permissions can review and adjust work sessions before timesheet approval. All adjustments are logged with reasons for audit purposes."
        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",
          "answer": "Yes. Previous pay periods remain accessible. Filter by date range to pull data from any past period."
        },
        "faq8": {
          "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",
          "answer": "Yes. Each work session links to a specific project. If a technician clocks into Building A for 4 hours, then Building B for 4 hours, both sessions show separately with their respective project attribution."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What about non-billable time like travel between sites?",
          "answer": "Non-billable work sessions track hours that cannot be charged to clients (travel, training, equipment maintenance, weather delays). The payroll view shows both billable and non-billable hours so you know your true labor cost."
        },
        "faq10": {
          "question": "Is there an approval workflow before export?",
          "answer": "Yes. Timesheets can be reviewed and approved before export. Approved timesheets generate clean export files. The workflow prevents exporting data that hasn't been verified."

      "fakeInspection": {
        "question": "Can I fake a harness inspection just to keep my score up?",

        "question": "What happens to my PSR if my employer has a low CSR?",
