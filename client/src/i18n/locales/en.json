Actual payroll calculations (CPP, EI, tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare) happen in your payroll processing software (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, etc.). OnRopePro handles time aggregation and export, not tax compliance."

            "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",

          "faq4": {
            "question": "What format does the export use?",

            "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",

          "faq7": {
            "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",

            "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",

          "question": "What happens if I try to assign someone who's on vacation?",

        "q3": {
          "question": "Can I still make scheduling decisions if there's a conflict?",

          "answer": "10 leave types: vacation, sick leave, personal leave, bereavement, jury duty, medical leave, family emergency, unpaid leave, training/development, and military leave. Each displays distinctly on the calendar."

          "question": "Can I see both projects and employees in one view?",

        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "What if someone calls in sick last minute?",

        "q9": {
          "question": "Is there mobile access for viewing schedules?",

        "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about the Quoting & Sales Pipeline module.",
        "q1": "How do technicians create quotes without seeing pricing?",
        "a1": "Financial Access permission controls pricing visibility. Users without this permission see quote forms with building data fields only. Drop counts, elevations, photos, notes—but no rate fields or totals. They submit complete site assessments that users with Financial Access then price.",
        "q2": "How do the service-specific pricing formulas work?",
        "a2": "Each service type has its own calculation method. Window cleaning: total drops ÷ daily productivity target = estimated hours. Parkade cleaning: stall count × rate = total. Caulking: linear feet × rate. You configure your own productivity targets and rates. The system calculates automatically.",
        "q3": "Can I customize the quote PDF layout?",
        "a3": "Quote PDFs include your company logo, itemized service breakdown, tower specifications, and total pricing. The format is standardized for professional appearance. Custom branding beyond logo placement is not currently available.",
        "q4": "How does the Kanban pipeline work?",
        "a4": "Quotes appear as cards in columns: Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Negotiation, Won, Lost. Drag cards between columns to update status. Click any card to view full quote details. Filter by date range, service type, or building.",
        "q5": "What happens when I convert a won quote to a project?",
        "a5": "Click \"Convert to Project\" on a Won quote. Building address, tower configurations, service specifications, budget hours, and client contacts transfer automatically. The new project links back to the original quote for reference.",
        "q6": "Can technicians take photos during site assessment?",
        "a6": "Yes. The mobile quote form includes photo upload for each elevation. Photos attach to the quote and appear in the PDF export. Use photos to verify access points, document complications, and support accurate pricing.",
        "q7": "How do multi-building quotes work?",
        "a7": "Add multiple towers within a single quote. Each tower has separate floor counts, drop counts per elevation, and service specifications. Quote total aggregates all towers. Work sessions later allow technicians to select which tower they're working on.",
        "q8": "Can I see quote history for a building?",
        "a8": "Yes. Buildings maintain quote history. View all quotes ever created for a specific address. Compare year-over-year pricing. Reference previous scope when creating new quotes.",
        "q9": "How do I track win rates?",
        "a9": "Pipeline analytics show quotes won vs. lost over time. Filter by service type, building size, or date range. Identify patterns in what you win and lose.",
        "q10": "Can multiple people work on the same quote?",
        "a10": "Yes. Technician creates initial assessment. Office manager reviews and adds client contacts. Owner adds pricing and approves for sending. Each user sees only the fields their permissions allow.",
        "q11": "How fast can I send a quote after site assessment?",
        "a11": "If technician completes mobile assessment and you have pricing ready, you can generate and send PDF within minutes of their submission. Same-day quoting becomes standard practice.",
        "q12": "What if I need to revise a submitted quote?",
        "a12": "Create a new version from the existing quote. Previous version is preserved for audit trail. Send the updated version to the client. Quote history shows all versions.",
        "q13": "Can building managers see our quotes directly?",
        "a13": "You control quote delivery. Export PDF and email it, or send directly through the system. Building managers see only what you explicitly share. Internal draft quotes remain private.",
        "q14": "How does this integrate with project management?",
        "a14": "Won quotes convert to projects. Budget hours from the quote become project budget. Actual hours tracked during work sessions compare against quoted estimate. You see if jobs ran over or under budget.",
        "q15": "Is there quote approval workflow?",
        "a15": "Permission controls determine who can move quotes to Submitted status. Configure so only owners or managers can finalize and send quotes. Technicians create drafts that require approval."

          "question": "Can residents see other residents' complaints?",
          "answer": "No. Residents can only view and interact with their own feedback submissions. Privacy is protected by design."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What happens when a resident moves to a different building?",
          "answer": "They update their Strata/LMS number in their profile and enter the new vendor's code. Their account is fully portable. If the new building's vendor uses OnRopePro, they see that vendor's projects. If not, they notice the gap."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can residents reopen closed feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Only company staff can reopen closed feedback. If a resident believes the issue persists, they contact their property manager or building manager directly. This prevents endless back-and-forth on resolved issues."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Can property managers respond to resident feedback?",
          "answer": "No. Property managers can view all feedback and communication history but cannot respond. Only company staff communicate with residents through the system. This keeps property managers informed without requiring their involvement."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "What's the difference between internal notes and visible replies?",
          "answer": "Internal notes are private (staff only) for coordination, investigation findings, and sensitive discussions. Visible replies are seen by the resident for acknowledgment, status updates, and resolution communication. Staff must explicitly toggle a yellow/red checkbox to make a reply visible, preventing accidental exposure."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How do residents get the vendor code?",
          "answer": "The code is posted on notices in the elevator during projects, provided by the building manager, or included in project communications. One code per company, used for all buildings that company services."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "Is there one code per building or one code per company?",
          "answer": "One code per company. All residents across all buildings serviced by that company use the same vendor code. The Strata/LMS number differentiates which building's projects they see."
        },
        "q8": {
          "question": "How long do residents have to submit feedback after a project completes?",
          "answer": "5 business days. This allows time for residents to notice issues while limiting the complaint window to a reasonable period."
        },
        "q9": {
          "question": "What happens if feedback sits unread?",
          "answer": "Notification badges show pending items in your dashboard. The \"Viewed\" timestamp is visible to the resident, so they know if no one has opened their feedback. This creates natural accountability."

        "a1": "New companies start at 75%. Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100%. From there, penalties are applied based on ongoing compliance gaps.",
        "q2": "What if I add Safe Work Procedures and my score drops?",
        "a2": "This is intentional. When you add new safety documents, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign them. This ensures documents aren't just uploaded and forgotten. Once all employees acknowledge the new procedures, your score returns to full compliance.",
        "q3": "How do harness inspection penalties work?",
        "a3": "The penalty is calculated as a percentage of missed inspections against total work sessions. If you have 1,000 work sessions and miss 10 inspections, that's a 1% penalty. If you're just starting and have 10 sessions with 5 missed inspections, that's a 50% penalty in this category. Consistent compliance over time builds a resilient score.",
        "q4": "Can technicians see my CSR before accepting job offers?",
        "a4": "Yes. Technicians evaluating potential employers can see company CSR ratings. This allows them to make informed decisions about safety before committing to a position.",
        "q5": "What do property managers see?",
        "a5": "Property managers see your overall CSR percentage and a color-coded badge (green, yellow, orange, or red) through their vendor dashboard. They can also see category breakdowns but not your internal operational details.",
        "q6": "Who cannot see my CSR?",
        "a6": "Building managers and residents. Building managers handle on-site logistics (keys, water, parking) and don't make vendor selection decisions. Residents seeing safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns without appropriate context.",
        "q7": "What documents are required for each project?",
        "a7": "Four documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing any of these for a project contributes to your project documents penalty.",
        "q8": "Can my score ever reach 100% again after adding employees or documents?",
        "a8": "Yes. 100% is achievable when all company documents are current, all projects have complete documentation, all work sessions have associated harness inspections, and all employees have signed all required documents. The system is designed so perfect scores are difficult to maintain long-term, reflecting that nobody is 100% safe forever.",
        "q9": "How quickly does the score update?",
        "a9": "Real-time. When a technician completes a harness inspection, when an employee signs a document, when a toolbox meeting is logged, the score recalculates immediately.",
        "q10": "What if a new employee joins and hasn't signed anything yet?",
        "a10": "Your score will decrease proportionally until they complete onboarding documentation. This incentivizes prompt completion of new employee safety training and document acknowledgments.",
        "q11": "Can I export CSR data for insurance or regulatory purposes?",
        "a11": "Yes. Generate PDF reports showing employee signatures with timestamps for all safety documents, harness inspection completion records, and toolbox meeting logs. These exports satisfy insurance auditors, WorkSafe inspectors, and IRATA/SPRAT compliance requirements.",
        "q12": "Is the CSR visible to competitors?",

          "question": "Can technicians see each other's pay rates?",

        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "How do residents get access to the portal?",
          "answer": "Building codes. The code appears on elevator notices, gets shared by technicians on-site, or sent by property managers. Resident enters the code, creates an account, instant access to their building's portal."

          "question": "What if a resident accidentally registers for the wrong unit?",
          "answer": "The system prompts: \"There's already an account for this unit. Are you a new resident?\" If they confirm, access transfers. If they realize the mistake, they go back and enter the correct unit."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "Can building managers see financial information?",

        "faq7": {
          "question": "How does feedback tracking work?",
          "answer": "Every submission timestamps automatically: when it was opened, when it was acknowledged, when it was resolved. The system calculates average response time and generates exportable reports for strata councils or property managers."

        "faq8": {
          "question": "Is my company's data separated from other OnRopePro customers?",

          "question": "What permissions are available?",

          "question": "What pay period options are available?",

        },
        "faq3": {
          "question": "How does overtime calculation work?",
          "answer": "You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it."
        },
        "faq4": {
          "question": "What format does the export use?",
          "answer": "CSV for payroll software import. PDF for printable timesheet records. Both include employee-level detail and project attribution."

        "faq5": {
          "question": "Who can see payroll data?",
          "answer": "Users with the canAccessFinancials permission. This is granted through the role-based permission system. Technicians see their own hours but not compensation rates or other employees' data."
        },
        "faq6": {
          "question": "What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?",

        },
        "faq7": {
          "question": "Can I see historical pay periods?",
          "answer": "Yes. Previous pay periods remain accessible. Filter by date range to pull data from any past period."

        "faq8": {
          "question": "Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?",
          "answer": "Yes. Each work session links to a specific project. If a technician clocks into Building A for 4 hours, then Building B for 4 hours, both sessions show separately with their respective project attribution."
        },
        "faq9": {
          "question": "What about non-billable time like travel between sites?",

        "faq10": {
          "question": "Is there an approval workflow before export?",

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "newPsr": {
        "question": "What if I've never used OnRopePro before? Do I start with a zero PSR?",
        "answer": "New technicians start building their PSR from their first inspection. There's no penalty for being new. Your score reflects your actual history on the platform."
      },
      "fakeInspection": {
        "question": "Can I fake a harness inspection just to keep my score up?",
        "answer": "No. The system requires you to step through each equipment category. Failed items automatically retire in inventory. The process takes 30 seconds when done honestly. Gaming it would take longer and create equipment management problems."
      },
      "psrEmployer": {
        "question": "What happens to my PSR if my employer has a low CSR?",
        "answer": "Your PSR is independent. It tracks your individual compliance, not your employer's overall score. A disciplined tech working for a disorganized company still builds strong PSR through their own actions."
      },
      "newCompany": {
        "question": "We're a new company. Won't we be at a disadvantage with a short history?",
        "answer": "New companies can reach 100% CSR immediately by uploading core documents and maintaining daily compliance. History matters for weathering occasional lapses, but new companies with disciplined practices quickly build competitive scores."
      },
      "pmSeePsr": {
        "question": "Do property managers see individual technician ratings?",
        "answer": "No. Property managers see company CSR only. Individual PSR is visible to employers during hiring, not to external parties."
      },
      "disagreeCsr": {
        "question": "What if I disagree with my CSR calculation?",
        "answer": "The dashboard shows exactly where you're losing points. If documentation shows 85% but you believe you're at 100%, you can see exactly which documents are missing signatures. The system doesn't hide its logic."
      },
      "surveillance": {
        "question": "This seems like surveillance. Is it?",
        "answer": "It's accountability. The same way a pilot's flight hours and certifications are tracked, your professional safety actions are tracked. This protects you when things go wrong. It builds your reputation when things go right. Your data belongs to you and travels with you."
