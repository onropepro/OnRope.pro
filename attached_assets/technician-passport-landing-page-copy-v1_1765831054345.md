**Module:** Technician Account (Technician Passport)

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** IRATA/SPRAT certified rope access technicians (Level 1, 2, 3)  
**Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware to Solution-aware  
**Core Insight:** Your career documentation is scattered, vulnerable, and starts over every time you change jobs. You've spent years earning every hour, but you don't own the record.  
**Psychological Frameworks:**
- Loss Aversion (protect what you've earned)
- Autonomy (own your career, not your employer)
- Portable Identity (your work follows you)
- Reciprocity (free value builds trust)
- Social Proof (join other professionals)

**Emotional Territory:** Protection, control, professional pride

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**Your Career Lives in Too Many Places**

### Body Copy
Your hours are in a crumpled notebook. Your certs are in a folder somewhere. Your last three employers have records you'll never see again.

When assessment day comes, you reconstruct months of work from memory. You guess at heights. You estimate dates. You hope the numbers add up.

Every new job means 15 forms with the same information. Banking details. Emergency contacts. Certification copies. Again. And again. And again.

Meanwhile, your Level 3 renewal is 47 days away. Or is it 67? You meant to check.

The rope access industry treats your work history like company property. OnRopePro treats it like what it is: yours.

One account. Complete history. Always with you.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Technicians

**"I can't remember what I did 3 months ago when filling my logbook."**

IRATA certification requires detailed logbooks with dates, heights, tasks, and locations. Filling these retrospectively means guessing at details, potentially understating hours, and risking questions during audits.

OnRopePro automatically logs every work session with exact dates, building addresses, heights, tasks performed, and duration. Sessions group by project. One export covers months of detailed activity.

**"Every new job means re-entering all my information."**

Switch employers and you're starting from scratch: new forms, new banking details, new certification copies, new emergency contacts. The rope access industry averages 2-3 employer changes per year. That's 45+ forms annually containing the same data.

Your Technician Passport stores everything once. When you accept an employer invitation, they receive your complete profile instantly. Update your address once, and every connected employer sees the change.

**"My IRATA certification expired and I didn't notice."**

IRATA certifications expire after 3 years. Miss the renewal window and you can't work legally. Assessment slots fill up during busy season. Employers discover expired certs at job sites.

PLUS accounts provide automated alerts at 60 days and 30 days before expiration. Plan assessments during slow season. Book early when slots are available.

**"I want to work for multiple companies but it's a paperwork nightmare."**

Managing separate paperwork, banking info, and certifications for each employer means administrative chaos. Some techs give up on side work because the hassle isn't worth it.

PLUS accounts allow unlimited employer connections. Accept invitations from multiple companies. Each receives your standardized profile. Hours log separately per employer.

**"I don't know how close I am to my next certification level."**

IRATA level progression requires specific hour thresholds. Techs track this manually, not knowing if they're 100 hours or 500 hours away. Some discover at assessment they don't qualify.

PLUS accounts display real-time level progression: your total hours, hours required for next level, hours remaining. Updates automatically as work sessions log.

**"I can't find job opportunities in my area."**

Rope access jobs aren't posted on Indeed or LinkedIn. Finding work means knowing people, random phone calls, or word-of-mouth. New technicians and those relocating have no systematic way to discover opportunities.

PLUS accounts access the OnRopePro Job Board showing employment opportunities from employers in your region. Apply with one click. Your complete profile sends automatically.

### For Employers

**"Onboarding paperwork gets lost in email chaos."**

New hire accepts job. You email safety documentation. They read it (maybe). They sign it (eventually). They email it back (sometimes to the wrong person). You file it (somewhere). Six months later, an auditor asks for proof of acknowledgment.

When a tech accepts your invitation, they must read and sign all safety documentation before accessing the Work Dashboard. Documents stored permanently with audit timestamps. No dashboard access until compliance is complete.

**"I can't verify a tech's qualifications quickly."**

Applicant claims Level 2 with First Aid. You ask for copies. They send blurry photos. You verify with IRATA manually. Days pass. You need bodies on site tomorrow.

Search any IRATA license number and instantly see: name, certification level, First Aid status, location. The tech approves the connection before you receive full profile access.

**"An employee claimed hours that didn't match the project timeline."**

Paper timesheets show 8 hours. No detail on which building, which elevation, what tasks. Disputes arise. Payroll errors follow.

When techs connect to your company, every work session logs automatically: building address, heights, specific tasks, duration. Sessions group by project. Complete, undisputable work records.

### For Property Managers

**"I can't verify contractor technician qualifications."**

You hire a rope access company, but how do you know their technicians are actually certified? You request documentation. It takes days. Certifications might be expired.

Through the Building Manager Portal, view technician profiles for contractors working on your property: certification levels, expiry dates, safety ratings. Real-time verification without phone calls.

## 9. How This Improves Your Career

### Section Header
**Stop Managing Paperwork. Start Managing Your Career.**

### Body Copy
How many hours have you lost to paperwork? Not work. Paperwork.

Forms for new employers. Forms for certification renewals. Forms for bank account changes. The same information, entered over and over, across years of your career.

Meanwhile, your actual work history lives in fragmented pieces: a logbook here, a spreadsheet there, records locked in your last employer's system forever.

Your Passport changes this.

One account holds everything: your hours, your certs, your safety record, your employer connections. Update your address once. It syncs everywhere. Log hours at one employer. They add to your career total.

When you're ready to assess for your next level, export a complete record covering every project, every height, every task. When you change jobs, transfer your professional identity in 10 seconds instead of 60 minutes of forms.

Your hours prove your career. Your Passport protects them.

## 10. FAQs

**"Do I need to pay for a Technician Passport?"**

No. Technician accounts are free forever. PLUS accounts are also free. Unlock PLUS by referring one other technician who creates an account.

**"What happens to my data if I leave a company?"**

Your Passport (certifications, work history, safety rating) stays with you permanently. Company-specific data (assigned gear, company documents) stays with that employer.

**"Can I use OnRopePro without connecting to an employer?"**

Yes. Create an account, store certifications, upload your resume, access the Job Board (PLUS). Automatic hour tracking activates when connected to an employer using OnRopePro.

**"Is my Social Insurance Number required?"**

No. SIN is completely optional. Refusing will not deny you service or limit your account. The SIN field streamlines payroll when you connect with employers, but you can provide it directly to your employer instead.

**"How do employers find me?"**

Employers search by IRATA license number. They see limited info (name, level, location) until you approve their connection request. Full profile access requires your consent.

**"What if I'm a company owner who also works as a technician?"**

When you create an employer account, you automatically receive a linked technician account. No separate registration needed. Your hours log alongside your employees.

**"Does this replace my IRATA logbook?"**

No. OnRopePro's automatic tracking assists your record-keeping but does not replace your official IRATA/SPRAT logbook. You remain responsible for maintaining your physical logbook per certification body requirements.

**"How secure is my information?"**

All financial data (banking, SIN) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM and stored on SOC2 Type II compliant infrastructure. OnRopePro operates in compliance with PIPEDA (Canada) and applicable provincial privacy legislation.

**"How do I get a PLUS account?"**

Refer one other technician who creates a Passport. Use your unique referral code. When they sign up, you unlock PLUS automatically.

**"What if I work in the US, not Canada?"**

SPRAT certification works the same as IRATA. US market launch is planned for Year 3, starting with West Coast markets. Sign up now to be notified when US features are available.
