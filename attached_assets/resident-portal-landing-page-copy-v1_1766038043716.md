## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness:** Problem-aware (they know complaint management is painful)  
**Core Insight:** Complaints aren't the problem. The chaos around handling them is.  
**Psychological Frameworks:**
- Loss Aversion (costly return visits, wasted labor)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one system vs. notebooks, phones, emails)
- Autonomy (self-serve status for residents, removal from loop for property managers)
- Network Effects (portable accounts create adoption pressure)

**Emotional Territory:** Relief from complaint chaos, control through transparency  
**Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Complaints handled while your crews are still on the ropes.**

### Alternative Headlines

1. **Stop sending crews back for a 10-minute fix that costs half a day.**
2. **The complaint system your residents will demand at their next building.**
3. **Turn "he said, she said" into documented, closed, done.**

### Subheadline

Residents submit feedback with photos. Your team sees it in real-time. Issues get resolved before the van leaves the parking lot. No more phone tag. No more return visits. No more notebooks.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

**The Complaint Problem Nobody Budgets For**

### Body Copy

A resident in unit 1247 emails about streaks on her window. A week later, she calls the building manager. The building manager calls you. You check your notebook. Maybe the email got lost. Maybe it didn't. Now three people are spending time on something that might have been resolved in 10 minutes if anyone had known about it while the crew was still in the building.

That 10-minute fix? It becomes a half-day labor cost. Packing equipment, loading the van, driving across town, rigging ropes for one window, cleaning it, derigging, driving back. You've done the math. You know what those return visits cost.

And that's just one complaint. During busy season, multiply it by buildings, by units, by the residents who give up entirely and complain on social media instead.

OnRopePro's Resident Portal puts feedback in front of your team while crews are still on-site. Residents submit issues with photos. Your supervisor sees a notification. The technician already rigged on that elevation flips their rope and checks the window. Problem solved in minutes, not days.

---

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header

**What This Module Does**

### Subheadline

Direct communication between residents and your company. Complete visibility for property managers. Zero phone tag.

### Intro Copy

The Resident Portal gives building residents a direct line to report issues, track project progress, and communicate with your team, all without involving property managers or building staff as middlemen.

---

### Card 1: Resident Feedback System

Residents submit feedback once with their description and optional photo. Name, unit number, and phone auto-fill from their account. Your team sees it immediately in the project dashboard with a notification badge.

**What gets captured:**
- Description of issue with optional photo evidence
- Unit number and resident contact info (auto-filled)
- Timestamp of submission
- Timestamp of when your team first viewed it

---

### Card 2: Two-Way Communication

Your staff respond through internal notes (private) or visible replies (resident sees). Residents can reply to visible messages. The complete conversation history stays attached to that feedback item forever.

**What gets tracked:**
- All messages between staff and resident
- Which messages are internal vs. visible
- Status changes (New, Viewed, Closed)
- Resolution timestamps for performance metrics

---

### Card 3: Project Progress Visibility

Residents view real-time project progress showing which elevation or side of the building is being worked on. They check status before calling to ask "when will you do my window?"

**What residents see:**
- Current elevation being worked (North, South, East, West)
- Overall completion percentage
- Scheduled project dates
- Active status indicators

---

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Eliminate return visits that cost half a day for one window.** When complaints come in a week after the job, you're sending someone back. Pack up, drive across town, rig for one window, clean it, pack up, drive back. Real-time feedback means issues get addressed while crews are still on-site. One prevented return visit per month pays for the entire system.

**Win contracts by demonstrating operational excellence.** When a property manager compares your bid against a competitor, show them your resolution time metrics and the resident portal. You handle feedback systematically. They rely on phone calls and emails. The choice becomes obvious.

**Stop drowning in complaint phone calls during busy season.** Every complaint phone call interrupts work, requires documentation, and needs follow-up. The mental load of tracking dozens of open issues across multiple buildings disappears when the system organizes everything by building and project automatically.

---

### For Operations Managers

**See all open issues per building in one view.** Five complaints come in for Building A on Monday, three more on Wednesday. Batch your deficiency visits efficiently because you can see what's open and where without reconstructing it from emails and voicemails.

**Prove you did the work.** A resident claims their window was never cleaned. Without documentation, you redo the work to keep the customer happy. With photo evidence, timestamps, and internal notes documenting investigation findings, you resolve disputes definitively.

**Coordinate without exposing sensitive discussions.** Internal notes let you write "check if this is from the previous contractor" or "dirt is on the inside, document for liability" without the resident seeing it. Clear toggle prevents accidental visibility.

---

### For Technicians

**Get feedback while you're still on the building.** You finish the west elevation on Tuesday. On Friday, a complaint comes in. Without the portal, you're context-switching back to a building you thought was complete. With real-time feedback, you address issues same-day while the work is fresh and equipment is deployed.

**Stop getting blamed for things outside your control.** The resident on the floor above watered their plants and dripped onto the window. Without documentation, you look incompetent. Internal notes let you document what actually happened, protecting your professional reputation.

---

### For Property Managers

**Get out of the middle.** When residents have issues, they call you. You call the vendor. You wait. You call the resident back. During a 40-story window washing project, that back-and-forth consumes hours. The resident portal removes you from the communication loop while maintaining complete visibility into every conversation.

**Evaluate vendor responsiveness with actual data.** When contract renewal comes, you have objective metrics. Average response time. Resolution time. You make data-driven decisions instead of relying on gut feel and scattered complaints.

**See the full context when escalations happen.** A resident insists their window wasn't cleaned. The vendor insists it was. When the resident escalates to you, view the complete feedback history including all messages, timestamps, and status changes. No more piecing together the story from both sides.

---

### For Building Residents

**Know your complaint was received and when it was seen.** Every submission is logged with a timestamp. You see the exact date and time when the company first opened your feedback. No more wondering if your email got lost.

**Submit once, with photos, and you're done.** Describe your issue, attach a photo, submit. Your name, unit number, and phone auto-fill. No repeating yourself to the property manager, then the vendor, then the technician.

**Check project progress before asking "are you done yet?"** See which side of the building crews are working on. If they haven't reached the north side yet, you'll know before calling to complain about your north-facing window.

---

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy

Every feature exists because Tommy tracked complaints in a notebook, sometimes on his hand while driving.

---

### Viewed Timestamp Visibility

Residents see exactly when their feedback was first opened by your company. No more "I didn't see it" excuses. If someone on your team opened it, there's a timestamp proving it. This creates accountability without requiring any manual logging.

---

### Photo Evidence Upload

Residents attach photos directly to their feedback. No more email threads asking for documentation. When a resident reports a water stain, you have the photo immediately. When you investigate and find the dirt is on the inside, you document that finding.

---

### Internal Notes System

Staff coordinate privately without exposing sensitive discussions to residents. Investigation notes, scheduling discussions, liability documentation. The yellow/red checkbox toggle makes it explicit when a reply will be visible to the resident, preventing accidental exposure.

---

### Portable Resident Accounts

When a resident moves from Toronto to Chicago, they keep their OnRopePro account. They update their Strata/LMS number and enter the new vendor's code. If their new building's vendor doesn't use OnRopePro, they notice. And they mention it.

---

### Resolution Time Metrics

The system calculates average response and resolution times automatically. Property managers see this data when evaluating vendors. Your resolution time becomes part of your competitive advantage, displayed alongside your Company Safety Rating.

---

### Real-Time Progress Tracking

Residents view which elevation is being worked on and overall completion percentage. They self-serve status information instead of calling to ask. You stop answering "when will you do my window?" calls from residents whose side hasn't been reached yet.

---

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"Deficiency visits cost me a half-day for one window."**

A complaint comes in a week after the job is done. Your technician packs up from their current site, the supervisor drives them to the complaint building, they set up ropes for one window, clean it, pack up, drive back. 4-6 hours of labor for one window. You know this math. You've lived it.

OnRopePro puts complaints in front of your team while crews are still on-site. A supervisor sees the feedback, dispatches a technician who's already rigged and working on that building to check the window. Problem solved in minutes. One prevented return visit per month easily pays for the entire system.

**"I'm drowning in complaint phone calls."**

During busy season, the operations manager's phone rings constantly. Each call interrupts work, requires documentation, and needs follow-up. Tommy used a notebook. Sometimes he wrote complaints on his hand while driving. A Google Form helped but required manually sorting 30 submissions from 5 different buildings.

All feedback is automatically organized by building and project. Notification badges show pending items. No phone calls to receive complaints, no manual sorting, no paper tracking. The mental load of tracking open issues disappears.

**"We look unprofessional compared to our competitors."**

When a property manager deals with Vendor A (no system) versus Vendor B (OnRopePro), the difference is stark. Vendor A requires the property manager to coordinate complaints. Vendor B handles everything automatically with complete transparency.

White-labeled resident portal with your company branding demonstrates professionalism. Resolution time metrics prove your responsiveness. The system itself becomes a competitive differentiator.

---

### For Property Managers

**"I'm the middleman for every complaint."**

During a 40-story window washing project, you receive 30+ calls about streaks, missed windows, and scheduling questions. Each call requires follow-up with the vendor, then follow-up with the resident. You spend more time managing complaints than managing the property.

Residents communicate directly with the vendor through the portal. You can view all feedback and communications for oversight without being in the middle of every exchange. You're removed from the loop while maintaining complete visibility.

**"I can't evaluate vendor responsiveness."**

Contract renewal comes and you rely on gut feel and resident complaints. Both vendors claim great customer service. You have no data to compare response times, resolution rates, or communication quality.

The system calculates average response time and resolution time for each vendor. You see this data alongside the Company Safety Rating when evaluating vendors. Objective performance metrics for vendor evaluation.

---

### For Residents

**"My complaints go into a black hole."**

You email about streaks on your window. A week later, nothing. You call the building manager, who calls the vendor, who says they never received the email. Three people are now involved in tracking down one complaint that may or may not have been sent.

Every feedback submission is logged with a timestamp. You see a "Viewed" status with the exact date and time when the company first opened your feedback. Complete transparency into status. No more uncertainty.

**"I have to explain my issue three times."**

You describe your problem over the phone, then repeat it to the property manager, then again to the vendor. Details get lost. "Can you send a photo?" adds another round of communication.

You submit feedback once with description and optional photo. The form auto-fills your name, unit number, and phone from your account. One submission captures everything. No repeated explanations, no lost photos.

---

### For Technicians

**"I find out about complaints a week after I've left the building."**

You work a building for several days, then move to the next job. A week later, you're told to go back. You've mentally moved on and now must context-switch back.

Complaints come in while you're still on-site. You can address issues same-day while the work context is fresh and equipment is deployed. Immediate feedback allows immediate resolution.

---

## 7. Measurable Results

### Eliminated Return Visits

Average cost of a deficiency return visit: $200-400 (half-day labor + travel). Real-time feedback prevents 2-5 return visits per month. Monthly savings: $400-2,000. Annual savings: $4,800-24,000. One prevented return visit pays for months of subscription cost.

---

### Reduced Phone Time

Average time per complaint phone call: 10-15 minutes. Average complaints per busy month: 50-100. Time saved: 8-25 hours per month. At $50/hour, that's $400-1,250 monthly in recovered operations manager time.

---

### Contract Retention

Property managers choose vendors who reduce their workload. The Resident Portal demonstrably removes property managers from the complaint loop. Renewal conversations become easier when you've made their job simpler all year.

---

### Competitive Differentiation

During bid presentations, demonstrating the resident portal and resolution time metrics separates your company from competitors managing complaints via phone and email. You show a system. They describe a process. Systems win.

---

## 8. Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy

The Resident Portal connects to other OnRopePro modules to create a unified operations system.

---

### Project Management Module

Feedback ties to specific projects. Residents see project progress including which elevation is being worked and completion percentage. When a project completes, residents have 5 business days to submit feedback.

---

### Company Safety Rating (CSR) Module

Resolution time metrics factor into your overall rating alongside safety data. Property managers see CSR and feedback metrics together when evaluating vendors. Responsive complaint handling improves your competitive positioning.

---

### White-Label Branding Module

The resident portal displays your company branding when the white-label module is active. Notices and communications show your company identity. Professional appearance for every resident interaction.

---

### Employee Management Module

Staff are assigned permissions to respond to feedback. As the system evolves, performance could be tracked by response quality, creating accountability at the individual level.

---

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header

**Stop Managing Complaints. Start Managing Growth.**

### Body Copy

Right now, complaint management looks like this: A phone call interrupts your day. You grab whatever's handy to write it down. You promise to follow up. You add it to the mental list of things that need attention. Multiply that by 50 buildings during busy season and you're drowning in administrative work that produces nothing.

The notebook Tommy used to track complaints still has pages with chicken scratch from phone calls taken while driving. The Google Form helped but created a new problem: sorting 30 submissions from 5 different buildings, then calling each resident individually. The complaint management "system" was whatever got written down that day.

With the Resident Portal, feedback organizes itself. By building. By project. With photos attached. With timestamps proving when it was seen. With resolution metrics calculating automatically. The chaos becomes a dashboard. The half-day return visits become same-day fixes. The phone calls become notifications you handle on your schedule.

What do you do with the hours you get back? Train your crews. Bid on new contracts. Take the call that actually grows your business. The complaint management that used to consume your operations manager's week becomes a check-the-dashboard morning routine.

## 10. FAQs

**Can residents see other residents' complaints?**

No. Residents can only view and interact with their own feedback submissions. Privacy is protected by design.

---

**What happens when a resident moves to a different building?**

They update their Strata/LMS number in their profile and enter the new vendor's code. Their account is fully portable. If the new building's vendor uses OnRopePro, they see that vendor's projects. If not, they notice the gap.

---

**Can residents reopen closed feedback?**

No. Only company staff can reopen closed feedback. If a resident believes the issue persists, they contact their property manager or building manager directly. This prevents endless back-and-forth on resolved issues.

---

**Can property managers respond to resident feedback?**

No. Property managers can view all feedback and communication history but cannot respond. Only company staff communicate with residents through the system. This keeps property managers informed without requiring their involvement.

---

**What's the difference between internal notes and visible replies?**

Internal notes are private (staff only) for coordination, investigation findings, and sensitive discussions. Visible replies are seen by the resident for acknowledgment, status updates, and resolution communication. Staff must explicitly toggle a yellow/red checkbox to make a reply visible, preventing accidental exposure.

---

**How do residents get the vendor code?**

The code is posted on notices in the elevator during projects, provided by the building manager, or included in project communications. One code per company, used for all buildings that company services.

---

**Is there one code per building or one code per company?**

One code per company. All residents across all buildings serviced by that company use the same vendor code. The Strata/LMS number differentiates which building's projects they see.

---

**How long do residents have to submit feedback after a project completes?**

5 business days. This allows time for residents to notice issues while limiting the complaint window to a reasonable period.

---

**What happens if feedback sits unread?**

Notification badges show pending items in your dashboard. The "Viewed" timestamp is visible to the resident, so they know if no one has opened their feedback. This creates natural accountability.

---

**Do residents see when we add internal notes?**

No. Internal notes are completely invisible to residents. They only see visible replies and status changes.
