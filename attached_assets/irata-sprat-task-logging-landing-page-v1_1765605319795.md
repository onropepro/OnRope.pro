## The Logging Problem Nobody Talks About

Your physical logbook is a mess.

The last entry was months ago. You can't remember which buildings you worked at, what tasks you performed, or how many hours you actually spent on rope. When you finally try to catch up, you end up guessing. Was that rope transfer on Tuesday or Wednesday? Did you do any rigging at Tower B, or just descending?

Here's the uncomfortable truth: when you bring six months of entries to your Level 3 for signing, they just sign. They weren't on every job with you. They have no idea if you actually did rope transfers on March 15th. But they sign anyway because that's how it's always been done.

One technician put it this way: "My last entry is December 29th, 2023. Two years. Where did I work in the past year? I don't even have access to my hours anymore because I don't work there. I don't have an account. It's all gone now."

OnRopePro changes this. Your hours log the same day you work them. Building names, task types, duration, all captured when you end your shift. And because your hours belong to your technician profile (not your employer), your career history follows you when you change jobs.

## Stakeholder Benefits

### For Rope Access Technicians

**Your career history belongs to you.** When you switch employers, your complete hour history comes with you. No more losing access to years of documented experience when you leave a company.

**No more backlog homework.** Hours log the same day while details are fresh. Building names, task types, duration. You never have to reconstruct what you did three months ago.

**Build diverse experience that matters.** Track not just total hours, but task diversity. When it's time for your Level 3 assessment, you have documented proof that you've done more than just descending for a thousand hours.

### For Company Owners

**Know what your techs can actually do.** When technicians use OnRopePro, you see verified hour history with task breakdowns. You know exactly how much rigging, rescue, and specialized work they've actually performed before assigning them to jobs.

**Make verification meaningful.** Digital approval flow means supervisors can review and approve hours daily while details are fresh. They can see which projects the tech worked on and verify the task types make sense. Your company's signature on a tech's hours actually represents verification, not just rubber-stamping.

**Plan workforce development with real data.** Hours logged flow into company-wide analytics. See skill distribution across your workforce. Identify gaps in team capabilities and plan training investments based on actual logged experience.

### For Level 3 Technicians & Supervisors

**Sign with integrity.** When entries are logged same-day and linked to specific projects, you can cross-reference against job records. "This tech logged rope transfers at Building X on Tuesday. I know that building has transfer points on the north elevation. Approve."

**Real-time verification beats rubber-stamping.** No more techs bringing six months of backlogged entries for mass signing. Review and approve while details are fresh and verifiable.

## Problems Solved

### For Rope Access Technicians

**"I haven't updated my logbook in months."**

Opening your physical logbook every day is tedious. You put it off for a week, then two weeks, then months. When you finally try to catch up, you can't remember which buildings you worked at, what tasks you performed, or how many hours you actually spent on rope.

OnRopePro logs your hours the same day, while details are fresh. Building names, task types, duration, all captured when you end your work session. Your career history builds automatically instead of becoming homework you keep avoiding.

**"I lost access to my hours when I left my last employer."**

Traditional timekeeping systems lock your data inside the company that employs you. When you leave, your documented experience disappears. You're back to paper logbooks and trying to reconstruct years of work history.

Your IRATA/SPRAT hours belong to YOUR technician profile, not your employer. When you move to a new company, your complete hour history comes with you automatically.

**"6 months without logged rope time could invalidate my cert."**

IRATA requires continuous evidence of rope access work. A six-month gap in your logbook raises questions during assessment. Without documented proof, your certification status becomes uncertain.

OnRopePro tracks every session automatically when connected to an employer. Independent techs log manually. Either way, you never have unexplained gaps that could jeopardize your credentials.

**"Nobody actually verifies what I write in my logbook."**

You're supposed to get your logbook signed regularly by a Level 3 or supervisor. But realistically, you bring six months of entries to your boss and they just sign everything without looking. There's no actual verification that you did what you claim.

When hours are logged same-day and linked to actual project locations, supervisors can verify entries against known work. "Tommy was at Marina Side today, I know there's rope transfers on that building. Approve." More credible records. More meaningful verification.

**"I switch between employers constantly."**

Contract rope access work means moving between companies regularly. Each new employer has different systems. Some track hours digitally, some use paper, some track nothing at all. Building a coherent career record across multiple employers is nearly impossible.

One profile. All employers. Every job you work through OnRopePro contributes to the same certification record, regardless of which company employed you that week.

### For Company Owners

**"I don't know if my techs are actually qualified."**

You hire a Level 2 tech who claims 2,000 hours of experience. But their logbook is a mess, with gaps everywhere, vague entries, and signatures from months ago. Are they actually experienced, or did they just accumulate time without developing real skills?

When techs use OnRopePro, you can see their verified hour history with task breakdowns. You know exactly how much rigging, rescue, and specialized work they've actually performed. Hire with confidence. Assign techs to jobs that match their actual documented experience level.

**"Signing logbooks is a rubber-stamp exercise."**

Your Level 3s are supposed to verify and sign tech logbooks. In reality, techs show up with months of backlogged entries and your supervisors just sign everything. There's no meaningful quality control.

Digital approval flow means supervisors can review and approve hours daily or weekly while details are fresh. They can see which projects the tech worked on and verify the task types make sense. Your company's signature on a tech's hours actually means something.

### For Level 3 Technicians & Supervisors

**"I'm signing off on hours I can't actually verify."**

A tech brings you six months of logbook entries to sign. You weren't on every job with them. You have no idea if they actually did rope transfers on March 15th or if they're padding their book. But you sign anyway because that's how it's always been done.

When entries are logged same-day and linked to specific projects, you can cross-reference against job records. "This tech logged rope transfers at Building X on Tuesday. I know that building has transfer points on the north elevation. Approve." Your IRATA/SPRAT number on an approval actually represents verification, not just rubber-stamping.

## Module Integration Points

IRATA/SPRAT task logging connects directly with other OnRopePro modules for complete operational visibility.

**Work Sessions & Time Tracking**
Task logging triggers automatically when ending a work session. Hours from the session become the starting point for IRATA hour allocation. Zero duplicate data entry required.

**Payroll & Compensation**
Work session hours feed payroll calculations while task hours track certification progress separately. Same shift, different purposes. Owners see billable time, technicians see career advancement.

**Safety & Compliance**
Harness inspections link to work sessions. IRATA logged hours include safety context. During audits, assessors can see that your logged rope hours occurred with proper safety protocols in place.

**Project Management**
Each logged task links to the project where work was performed. Your logbook shows not just hours and tasks, but building names and project types for complete work history context.

**Employee Profiles**
IRATA certification level displays on technician profiles. Logged hours accumulate toward next level requirements. Owners see crew qualification levels when assigning teams to projects.

**Analytics & Reporting**
Hours logged flow into company-wide analytics. Owners see skill distribution across their workforce. Identify gaps in team capabilities and plan training investments based on actual logged experience.

## How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

Right now, your technicians spend 15 minutes every few months trying to reconstruct what they did on specific days. They guess. They approximate. They write things down that may or may not be accurate. And then your Level 3s sign it all without really checking because there's no way to verify what happened three weeks ago.

This is the industry standard. It's also a liability waiting to happen.

With OnRopePro, hours log the same day. Supervisors verify against known project assignments. Techs build documented proof of diverse experience. And everyone has access to their complete career history regardless of which company currently employs them.

Stop managing logbook compliance through guilt and reminder emails. Start building verifiable certification records that actually mean something.

## FAQs

**Does this replace my physical IRATA/SPRAT logbook?**

No. IRATA and SPRAT still require physical logbooks. WorkSafeBC and other regulatory bodies may request to see your written records on-site. OnRopePro is a digital supplement that helps you maintain accurate records, never lose your hour history, and have a reliable backup for your paper logbook.

**What happens to my hours if I change employers?**

Your IRATA/SPRAT hours belong to your technician profile, not your employer. When you move to a new company, your complete hour history comes with you automatically. No re-entry required.

**Can I log hours if I'm not connected to an employer on the platform?**

Yes. Independent technicians can manually log their hours and tasks. You can also scan your existing paper logbook to import historical data.

**How do I log training hours from external courses?**

Training at IRATA/SPRAT schools counts as rope time. Use the manual entry feature to add training hours, specifying the training provider and skills practiced.

**What's the difference between shift hours and task hours?**

Shift hours are your total time at work. Task hours are the actual time performing rope access activities. An 8-hour shift might only include 6-7 hours of actual rope work after breaks, travel, and ground prep. The system prompts you to specify how many of your shift hours were actual task hours.

**What if my employer doesn't use OnRopePro?**

You can still create a technician account and log hours manually. When your employer eventually joins the platform (or you move to an employer who uses it), your existing hour history integrates automatically.

**Can Level 3s approve hours digitally?**

Digital signature and approval flow is planned for future release. Currently, hours log to your profile without supervisor sign-off. Once IRATA formally approves digital logging, the approval workflow will activate.

**What if I have no logged rope time for 6 months?**

IRATA may consider your certification invalid until recertification if you have no logged rope time for 6 months. Consistent logging through OnRopePro ensures you never have unexplained gaps that could jeopardize your credentials.

**Is this a Plus feature or standard?**

Logbook scanning and basic hour logging are available to all technician accounts. Certification progress tracking (hours remaining to next level) requires Plus.

## Important Disclaimer

**This Does NOT Replace Your Physical Logbook**

IRATA and SPRAT still require you to maintain a physical logbook. WorkSafeBC and other regulatory bodies may request to see your written logbook on-site. OnRopePro's digital logging is a supplement that helps you maintain accurate records, not a replacement for your official certification documentation.

If you have no logged rope time for 6 months, your certification may be considered invalid until recertification. Consistent logging protects your credentials.

**Strategic Foundation**

Target audience awareness stage: Problem-aware (they know logbooks are a mess, they know it's risky, they don't know a solution exists)

Core insight: The logbook problem isn't about laziness. It's about friction. Removing friction removes the problem.

Psychological frameworks:
- Loss Aversion (don't lose your career history when you switch jobs)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one action logs hours, no reconstruction homework)
- Status Quo Bias (it's worth switching because the current system is provably broken)
- Identity (your professional passport belongs to you, not your employer)

Emotional territory: Relief (end of frustration), Protection (your credentials are documented), Validation (your experience is verified and portable)
