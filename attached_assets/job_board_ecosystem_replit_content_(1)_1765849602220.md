# Job Board Ecosystem - Complete Content for Replit

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for TSX Implementation

## The Golden Rule

> **The Job Board is a closed-garden ecosystem. Every employer is verified. Every technician is relevant. No noise.**

### The Network Effect Formula

```
Value = Verified Employers × Qualified Technicians × Industry Specificity
```

**Why This Matters:** Unlike Indeed where rope access jobs are buried among thousands of irrelevant listings and you pay $22 per application, OnRopePro creates a focused marketplace. Employers only see rope access technicians. Technicians only see rope access building maintenance jobs. No bakeries posting jobs. No pipe fitters applying. The more companies and techs join, the more valuable it becomes for everyone.

**Validated from transcript (Lines 119-134):**
> "This is a very defined space where you have real actual companies who are posting and real actual workers... there's no bakeries posting jobs. There's no car washes posting jobs."

## Section 1: Introduction (REWRITE)

**Current:**
> The Job Board Ecosystem connects rope access technicians with employment opportunities across the platform. Companies and SuperUsers can post jobs, while technicians can browse listings, apply directly, and make their profiles visible to potential employers.

**New:**
> Stop posting on Indeed, Craigslist, and Facebook hoping qualified rope techs see your job. OnRopePro's Job Board is a closed ecosystem exclusively for rope access building maintenance. Every employer is verified. Every technician is relevant. No $22 per-application fees. No filtering through 50 resumes to find 2 actual rope techs. No spam.

---

## Section 2: Problems Solved (NEW SECTION)

*Add this section BEFORE "For Employers"*

### Section Header
**Icon:** AlertTriangle or Target  
**Title:** Problems Solved

### For Employers

**Problem 1: "I Post on Indeed and Get 50 Applicants, But Only 2 Are Actual Rope Access Techs"**

You post on Indeed, LinkedIn, Craigslist, and Facebook. You get flooded with applications from people who have never touched a rope system. Shop laborers, general construction workers, people who "are interested in learning." Hours wasted filtering irrelevant resumes.

OnRopePro's Job Board is a closed ecosystem. Every technician on the platform is in rope access building maintenance. Every employer is verified. When you post a job, 100% of applicants are relevant.

**Problem 2: "Indeed Keeps Charging Me Even When I'm Not Hiring"**

Indeed charges $22 per application if you don't respond within 2 days. A single job posting can cost $300+ in "engagement fees" before you've hired anyone. Someone has to log in daily, open every application, decline or respond. Miss a few days? That's $22 times every unopened application.

OnRopePro's Job Board is included in your subscription. Post unlimited jobs. Receive unlimited applications. No per-application fees. No surprise charges.

**Problem 3: "I Found a Good Tech But They Want Way More Than I Can Pay"**

You spend an hour interviewing a candidate, checking references, preparing an offer, only to discover their salary expectations are $20/hour above your budget. Complete waste of time for both parties.

Technicians set their expected pay rate in their profile. When you browse talent, you see what they're looking for before you reach out. If someone won't work under $60/hour and your budget is $45, you know immediately.

### For Technicians

**Problem 4: "I Want to Find a Rope Access Job But Indeed Shows Me Pipe Fitter and Welder Jobs"**

You search "rope access" on Indeed and get results for offshore oil rigs, industrial access in Alberta, and random construction gigs. You spend 30 minutes scrolling through irrelevant listings to find 2-3 that might be building maintenance.

OnRopePro's Job Board is exclusively for rope access building maintenance. Every job posted is relevant. Filter by job type, location, and certifications. No oil rigs. No pipe fitting. Just building maintenance.

**Problem 5: "I Don't Want Every Company to See My Profile"**

You're currently employed but casually looking. You don't want your current employer to know you're browsing jobs. Or you simply value your privacy.

Profile visibility is opt-in. Toggle it on when actively looking. Toggle it off when you're not. Control exactly which fields employers see.

### For Building Managers / Property Managers

**Problem 6: "How Do I Know This Contractor Hires Qualified Workers?"**

You hire a rope access contractor but have no visibility into who they're actually sending to your building. Are these people certified? Do they have safety records? You're trusting the contractor's word.

When contractors use OnRopePro, their technicians have verified IRATA/SPRAT certifications and visible safety ratings. You're not just trusting their word. You're seeing documented credentials.

## Validated Quotes (For Reference)

Use these for marketing materials or additional documentation:

**On closed ecosystem value (Lines 127-129):**
> "If you type rope access on Indeed, you can't really type rope access window washing Vancouver... but now with this place, that's all you're gonna find."

**On Indeed fees (Lines 139-149):**
> "Indeed has a weird way of making you pay... if you don't do anything after two days, you're being billed... it's $22 every time."

**On expected pay rate (Lines 114-116):**
> "The tech are also putting in their profile what they want for money... when the employer goes to look up for talent... this guy won't work under 60 bucks an hour. He can be like, yeah, no."

**On profile visibility control (Lines 85-87):**
> "The technician can go in there... toggle the switch on and they decide what they want the employer to see."

**On organic growth (Lines 240-244):**
> "I think we should just... let it happen organically... because we shit talk Indeed a lot too."

## Section 10: Best Practices & Tips (NEW SECTION)

### For Employers

**Do:**
- ✅ Include salary range in job postings (attracts more qualified applicants)
- ✅ Check expected pay rates in Talent Browser before sending offers
- ✅ Respond to applications promptly (builds your platform reputation)
- ✅ Review Individual Safety Rating when evaluating candidates

**Don't:**
- ❌ Post vague job descriptions (reduces quality of applicants)
- ❌ Send offers without an active job posting linked
- ❌ Ignore safety ratings when making hiring decisions
- ❌ Wait weeks to respond to applications (top candidates move fast)

### For Technicians

**Do:**
- ✅ Keep profile updated with current certifications and experience
- ✅ Set a realistic expected pay rate based on your level and market
- ✅ Use profile visibility toggle strategically (on when looking, off when not)
- ✅ Upload a professional photo and current resume

**Don't:**
- ❌ Leave profile incomplete (reduces chances of being found by employers)
- ❌ Set expected pay rate artificially high (filters you out of searches)
- ❌ Apply to jobs you're not qualified for (hurts your platform reputation)
- ❌ Forget to check your portal for job offer notifications

## Section 11: Frequently Asked Questions (NEW SECTION)

**"Is there a cost per application like Indeed?"**

No. Unlike Indeed's $22 per-application fee structure, OnRopePro includes unlimited job postings and applications in your subscription. Post as many jobs as you want. Receive as many applications as you want. No surprise charges.

**"Will you scrape jobs from Indeed or other sites?"**

No. OnRopePro's Job Board grows organically. We don't import jobs from other platforms. This ensures every listing is from a verified rope access building maintenance company within our ecosystem.

**"Can I see who applied to my jobs?"**

Yes. Employers see all applications with profile details, resume, certifications, and safety ratings for technicians who have enabled profile visibility.

**"What if I'm employed but casually looking?"**

Keep your profile visibility toggled off. You can still browse and apply to jobs. Toggle it on only when you want employers to find you proactively.

**"Can technicians see my company information before applying?"**

Yes. Technicians can view company details, job requirements, location, and salary range (if provided) before deciding to apply.

**"How do I send a job offer to a specific technician?"**

From the Talent Browser, find the technician you want to hire. Click "Send Job Offer" and select which of your active job postings to link the offer to. The technician receives a notification in their portal.

**"What happens after I accept a job offer?"**

If you're already on the platform, onboarding is nearly instant. The employer enters your salary and permissions. You're ready to work on day one with no re-entry of your information.
