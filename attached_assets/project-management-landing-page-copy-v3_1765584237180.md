## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware
- They know tracking multiple projects is chaos
- They know spreadsheets and whiteboards aren't working
- They may not know a rope-access-specific solution exists

**Core Insight:** Your brain is not a project database, and the exhaustion of treating it like one costs you money, relationships, and sleep.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Cognitive Load Reduction** (primary) - One system carries the mental burden
2. **Loss Aversion** - What you're losing right now in time, money, accuracy
3. **Autonomy/Competence** - Technicians want to know their targets and track their own improvement
4. **Social Proof via Transparency** - Building managers see you as "the most organized contractor we work with"

**Emotional Territory:** Relief from chaos + professional pride

**Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) with Before-After-Bridge elements

**Tactical Approach:**
- B2B copy: Lead with ROI/business outcomes, specific metrics
- Tech/Innovation: Lead with impossible made possible
- Relief-based triggers: End of frustration, simplification, peace of mind, time savings

## 2. Problem Statement Section

**Section Header:**
The Reality

**Body Copy:**

You're juggling window washing at Tower A, caulking at Building B, anchor inspections at Complex C. A client calls asking for a status update.

You're guessing.

You think Tommy's finishing the north elevation today. Maybe. Sarah might have capacity next week. Probably. That 15-story quote you just sent? You pulled the timeline from memory because you couldn't find your notes from the similar job six months ago.

Many times you've had to go from project to project and look at the guys on the rope and take notes of where they're at compared to where they were yesterday. Ten to fifteen hours a week just figuring out what's happening.

Then there's the performance problem nobody talks about. One guy on the cell phone half the day, does one drop. The other guy working his ass off. They were there the same amount of time. You know something's wrong. Without hard data, you can't have the conversation.

Your brain is your business. And it's exhausted.

OnRopePro changes the equation. Every project visible from one screen. Progress updates automatically as work sessions get logged. Per-employee performance tracked with objective data. The information is at your fingertips instead of scattered across your memory, your whiteboard, and six different text threads.

Everything is linked with everything. Create a project and it fills the schedule. Employees log work and it fills payroll. If you do one thing, it does something else for you somewhere else.

The system carries the cognitive load. Your mental bandwidth opens up for actually running the business.

## 3. What This Module Does

**Section Header:**
What This Module Does

**Subheadline:**
The operational hub connecting scheduling, safety, and payroll

**Intro Copy:**
Projects track individual building maintenance jobs with progress measured the way rope access actually works.

---

**Card 1: Progress Tracking by Job Type**

The system adapts to your work, not the other way around.

Drop-based tracking for window cleaning and building wash counts vertical passes per elevation. North, East, South, West tracked independently. Hours-based tracking for inspections and repairs captures time with manual completion percentage. Unit-based tracking for parkade cleaning and in-suite services counts individual stalls or suites completed.

The form technicians see when ending a work session changes based on what they're working on. Drop-based jobs ask for directional counts. Hours-based jobs ask for completion percentage. No forcing your operations into someone else's template.

**What gets tracked:**
- North, East, South, West elevations independently
- Drops completed per session per direction
- Hours worked with completion estimates
- Units or stalls finished

---

**Card 2: Automatic Calendar Population**

Create a project once. The schedule fills itself.

When you enter a date range and assign employees, calendar entries appear automatically. No more creating a project, then opening Google Calendar, then texting your supervisor, then updating the whiteboard. Same information, one entry, everywhere it needs to go.

Building gets pushed by a week? Click the project, change the date. It syncs everywhere. Conflict detection flags when someone is double-booked before it becomes an emergency.

**What gets automated:**
- Multi-day project bars on company calendar
- Employee assignments visible on their schedules
- Color coding by job type
- Conflict detection for double-booking

---

**Card 3: Linked Documentation**

Safety docs live with their projects. Not in email. Not in Google Drive. Not in a folder in the truck.

Each project connects to its Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting records, and Anchor Inspection Certificates. Property managers access compliance documents through their portal without emailing you. Auditors find everything in one place.

When the insurance company asks for proof of your safety program, you're not digging. You're clicking.

**What gets linked:**
- Rope Access Plans (RAP)
- Toolbox Meeting records
- Anchor Inspection Certificates
- Project photos

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**See all your projects without leaving your desk.** The dashboard shows every active job with completion percentage, days remaining, and assigned crew. Filter by status, building, or technician. Updates automatically as work sessions get logged. No more driving site to site taking notes of where crews are compared to yesterday.

**Know who's performing and who's coasting.** Per-employee performance tracking shows drops completed per session, target achievement rates, and historical trends. You can see that Tommy did five drops every day at this building while another employee only did one. They were there the same amount of time. Now you have the data for the conversation you couldn't have before.

**Quote future jobs with confidence.** Historical project data shows how long similar buildings actually took. Search past projects by building type, job type, or date range. "Last time we did a 20-story window wash, it took 14 days with 2 techs averaging 8 drops per day." Stop guessing and overbidding by 50%. Stop underbidding and losing money.

**Reduce your psychological load.** The time you spend looking at projects on one screen, schedule on another, checking if you put Devon somewhere, keeping all these projects straight and having enough people on each. That mental bandwidth gets freed up. Everything is linked with everything. The system remembers so you don't have to.

---

### For Technicians

**Know your target before you start.** Your mobile app shows assigned projects with clear daily expectations. Marina Towers, Window Cleaning. Your target: 5 drops per day. Yesterday you completed: 4 drops. No more finding out after the fact that the boss expected something different.

**See where you're working tomorrow.** Your upcoming assignments appear on your phone tonight. Tomorrow: Marina Towers, 8:00 AM. Thursday: Ocean View Apartments, 8:00 AM. Plan your commute the night before instead of waiting for a 6 AM text that sends you to the wrong building.

**Track your own improvement.** Your performance dashboard shows drops per day average, target achievement rate, and trends over time. This month: 4.8 drops per day, 86% target achievement. Last month: 4.1 drops per day. You're improving, and now you can prove it during your review.

---

### For Building Managers

**Stop playing telephone.** Log in and see the exact same progress the rope access company sees. Real-time completion percentages by elevation. Before and after photo galleries. Safety documentation. When the building owner asks "How's it going?", answer immediately instead of "I'll call them and find out."

**Verify contractor performance objectively.** The dashboard shows whether work is progressing on schedule. South Elevation: 73% complete. Expected completion: Dec 8. No more relying on verbal updates that might be optimistic. Data you can trust when evaluating vendor performance.

---

### For Property Managers

**Reduce your communication overhead.** Residents check progress themselves through their portal. They see which elevation is being worked, when their floor is expected, and the upcoming schedule. Status calls drop 60-70%. Your phone stops ringing with "when will they be done?" questions.

**Demonstrate professional vendor management.** When building owners ask about contractor oversight, show them the portal. Real-time progress tracking. Documented safety compliance. Photo verification. You become known as the property manager who uses technology to ensure accountability.

---

### For Residents

**Know when work will reach your window.** The resident portal shows progress specific to your elevation. South Elevation: 45% complete. Expected to reach your floor Thursday Dec 12. Entire elevation complete by Dec 15. Plan your life around the work instead of wondering.

**Birthday party on Sunday?** Check the schedule. They're not working that day. No need to call the property manager and wait two days for an answer while you worry about strangers outside your window during the party.

---

## 5. Key Features

**Intro Copy:**
Built for how rope access operations actually work. Not retrofitted from generic project management software.

---

**Directional Drop Tracking**

Track progress on each building elevation independently. North, East, South, and West each show their own drop count, completion percentage, and assigned crew. High-rise window cleaning rarely finishes all sides at once. Different access requirements. Different crew assignments. Different timelines. The system matches your reality.

---

**Real-Time Progress Dashboard**

See every active project's completion percentage, days remaining, and crew assignment from one screen. Updates automatically as work sessions get logged. Filter by status, building, job type, or technician. Visual progress bars flag when projects fall behind target before clients notice.

---

**Flexible Tracking Methods**

Drop-based, hours-based, or unit-based tracking depending on the job type. The form technicians see when ending a work session changes based on what they're working on. Drop-based jobs ask for N/E/S/W counts. Hours-based jobs ask for completion percentage. Unit-based jobs count stalls or suites. The system adapts.

---

**Automatic Calendar Integration**

Creating a project with a date range and assigned employees automatically populates calendar entries. Multi-day project bars. Color coding by job type. Conflict detection when employees are double-booked. Drag and drop rescheduling syncs back to project assignments. No more "Oh shit, I forgot to schedule that" emergencies.

---

**Custom Job Types**

Create company-specific job types for specialized work. Define the name and tracking method. Choose whether it's elevation-based, time-based, or unit-based. Custom types save and become reusable. Your weird niche service that no generic software understands? Define it once, use it forever.

---

**Piece Work Mode**

For drop-based projects, enable piece work compensation instead of hourly. Set rate per drop. System calculates pay automatically. 20 drops at $8 per drop equals $160 for that session. No spreadsheets. No manual calculations. No disputes about how pay was calculated.

---

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**"I have no idea where my six active projects actually stand."**

You're managing window washing at one building, caulking at another, inspections at a third. When clients call asking for status, you're guessing based on what you remember from yesterday's phone call with your supervisor. You've had to drive from project to project, look at the guys on the rope, take notes of where they're at compared to yesterday. Ten to fifteen hours a week just figuring out what's happening.

The dashboard shows every project's completion percentage, days remaining, assigned crew, and forecast. Filter by status, building, or technician. Updates automatically as work sessions get logged. Instant oversight without site visits. Answer client status questions with exact percentages instead of vague optimism.

---

**"One tech is crushing it while another coasts, and I can't prove it."**

Sometimes the guys won't even say anything. One guy on the cell phone half the day, does one drop. The other guy working his ass off. They were there the same amount of time. What's going on? You know something's wrong. Without hard data, you can't have the conversation. The high performer feels invisible. The underperformer coasts undetected.

Per-employee performance tracking shows drops completed per session, target achievement rates, and historical trends. You can see that Tommy did five drops every day at this building, but another employee only did one. Objective data for the coaching conversation you've been avoiding because you couldn't prove anything.

---

**"I create a project, then manually re-enter everything into my calendar."**

You win a contract. You create the project in your system. Then you open Google Calendar and block dates. Then you text your supervisor crew assignments. Then you update your whiteboard. Same information, four places, 30-45 minutes per project. And you still forget things.

Creating a project with date range and assigned employees automatically populates calendar entries. The schedule fills itself by creating projects. If the building gets pushed by a week, click the project and change the date. It syncs everywhere. Zero redundant data entry. Impossible to forget calendar entries.

---

**"My brain is my business, and it's exhausted."**

The time you spend looking at your projects on one screen, then having your schedule on another screen, then checking if you put Devon somewhere. It's keeping all these projects straight and having enough people on each. You wake up at 3 AM wondering if you scheduled Tommy for the job starting tomorrow. You check your phone. You didn't. You can't fall back asleep.

Everything is linked with everything. Create a project and it fills the schedule. Employees log work and it fills payroll. If you do one thing, it does something else for you somewhere else. The system carries the cognitive load. Your mental bandwidth opens up. You can take vacation without midnight panic attacks.

---

**"Building managers call me constantly asking how it's going."**

Your building manager client has no visibility into project progress. They're fielding resident questions and have no answers. They call or text you 5-10 times per week asking for updates. You spend 3-4 hours per week on status calls instead of productive work. And you still sound vague because you don't have instant access to current progress either.

Building manager portal gives them identical visibility to your internal dashboard. They log in anytime, see real-time progress by elevation, review photo galleries, check schedules. Status call volume drops 80%. They perceive you as tech-savvy and professional. "Most organized contractor we work with."

---

### For Building Managers and Property Managers

**"Residents call me constantly asking when it will be done."**

You receive 15-30 status calls per week during building maintenance projects. Residents assume the worst because they have no visibility. You're playing telephone between the contractor and 40 units. Unit 402 has a birthday party on Sunday and calls you at 8 PM Friday demanding the crew not work near their windows. Two hours of chaos that could have been avoided.

Residents can see how the project is progressing so they're not constantly contacting you saying "Hey, when's this going to get done?" They check the portal instead of calling. They see the schedule shows Sunday is off. They submit feedback directly if issues arise. Your phone stops ringing.

---

**"I have no visibility into contractor progress."**

You hired a rope access company. You have no way to verify they're working efficiently or meeting timeline commitments without physically visiting the building or constantly calling the owner. When the building owner asks "Are they on track?", you have to say "I'll find out."

You can just log in and see the exact same dashboard the rope access company sees. Real-time progress. Crew assignments. Safety documentation. Photo verification. Answer building owner questions immediately with "Let me check the portal, they're 68% complete, ahead of schedule."

---

### For Residents

**"I have no idea when they'll finish my elevation."**

Workers hanging on ropes outside your building. You don't know when they'll be near your unit. You're planning a family gathering this weekend. Will there be strangers outside your windows? You call the property manager. They don't know. They call the rope access company. Two days later you get an answer. Two days of unnecessary worry.

The resident portal shows progress specific to your elevation. South Elevation: 45% complete. Expected to reach your floor Thursday Dec 12. Entire elevation complete by Dec 15. Schedule shows they're not working Sunday. Peace of mind through transparency without bothering anyone.

---

### For Technicians

**"I don't know what my daily target is."**

You show up to the job site. You start working. Are you meeting expectations? You complete 3 drops. You think that's good. Your supervisor seems frustrated. Later you find out the target was 5 drops per day. Nobody told you. You feel blindsided at the review.

Mobile app shows assigned projects with clear daily targets. Marina Towers, Window Cleaning. Your target: 5 drops per day. Yesterday you completed: 4 drops. Clear expectations before you start. Self-manage your pace. Know if you're on track before supervisor feedback.

---

**"I don't know where I'm working tomorrow."**

You finish work. You ask your supervisor where you're going tomorrow. They say they'll text you tonight. 9 PM, nothing. You text them. They're busy. 6 AM you get a rushed message. You show up to the wrong building because you misunderstood yesterday's hurried instructions. 45 minutes wasted. Day starts frustrated.

Your mobile app shows upcoming assignments. Tomorrow: Marina Towers, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Thursday: Ocean View Apartments, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Plan your commute the night before. Know what equipment to bring. Professional clarity about your schedule.

---

## 7. Measurable Results

**Time Savings**

Manual calendar management takes 30-45 minutes per project. Creating the project, blocking calendar dates, texting crew assignments, updating the whiteboard, checking for conflicts. With automatic calendar population, project creation takes 5 minutes. For 20 projects per month, that's 8+ hours saved monthly. Annual time savings worth $7,500 at owner rates.

---

**Payroll Accuracy**

Work sessions logged in the field automatically feed payroll calculations. Drop counts, hours, and units convert directly to wages. No transcription from paper timesheets or text messages. 87-93% reduction in payroll errors. Zero disputes over hours worked because the system timestamps everything and the data trail is complete.

---

**Communication Efficiency**

Residents and building managers check progress themselves instead of calling. Property manager status calls drop 60-70% per active project. For building managers handling 15-30 status calls per week during projects, that's 20+ hours per month reclaimed. Your reputation improves because you look organized and transparent.

---

**Quote Accuracy**

Historical project data shows how long similar buildings actually took. Average drops per day by job type. Labor hours per elevation. Project duration trends. Quote preparation drops from 45 minutes to 10 minutes. Pricing accuracy improves 15-20%. Fewer lost contracts from overbidding. Fewer losses from underbidding.

---

## 8. Modules This Module Communicates With

**Intro Copy:**
Projects are the operational hub. Data flows in from employee assignments and out to payroll, safety, and scheduling. One entry, everywhere it needs to go.

---

**Employee Management**

Crew assignments pull from your employee directory. The system shows which technicians have which IRATA levels and certifications. Performance metrics generated from project work sessions feed back into employee records for reviews and career tracking.

---

**Work Sessions and Time Tracking**

When technicians log work sessions on a project, that data automatically populates payroll. Drop counts, hours, or units convert to wages based on configured rates. No manual timesheet transcription. The guys work, but it fills the payroll.

---

**Payroll**

Project-specific tracking feeds payroll calculations directly. Drop-based projects calculate piece work pay. Hours-based projects calculate hourly wages. The payroll module pulls all session data without manual entry. 87-93% error reduction.

---

**Safety and Compliance**

Each project links to its safety documentation. Rope Access Plans, Toolbox Meeting records, Anchor Inspection Certificates. Building managers access compliance documents through their portal without emailing you. Complete audit trail for insurance and regulatory requirements.

---

**Job Schedule and Calendar**

Creating a project with dates and assigned employees automatically generates calendar entries. Drag and drop rescheduling syncs back to project assignments in real time. Conflict detection flags double-booked employees before it becomes an emergency.

---

**Buildings Database**

Projects link to building records containing address, contact information, access instructions, and historical maintenance data. When you create a project at a building you've worked before, existing building data autofills. No re-entering details for repeat clients.

---

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

**Section Header:**
Stop Juggling. Start Managing.

**Body Copy:**

Right now you're spending 10-15 hours per week just figuring out what's happening. Driving site to site. Taking notes. Comparing where crews are today versus yesterday. Trying to remember which project is behind and which technician might need coaching. Checking if you put Devon somewhere. Waking up at 3 AM wondering if you forgot to schedule tomorrow's job.

The dashboard shows you everything without leaving your desk. Real-time progress. Per-employee performance. Calendar automatically populated. Conflicts flagged before they become emergencies. Building managers checking progress themselves instead of calling you.

When a client calls, you answer immediately with exact percentages instead of vague optimism. When a technician underperforms, you have the data for the conversation. When you bid a new project, you know how long similar buildings actually took. When the insurance company asks for safety documentation, you're clicking, not digging.

Your brain stops being the database. The system carries the cognitive load. Your mental bandwidth goes to growing the business instead of tracking the business. You can actually take vacation. The business runs whether you're watching or not.

---

## 10. FAQs

**How does drop-based tracking work?**

Technicians log drops completed per elevation at the end of each work session. The system asks for North, East, South, and West counts separately. Progress calculates automatically based on target drops per direction. Visual progress bars show completion by elevation.

---

**Can building managers see everything we see?**

No. Building managers see project progress, schedules, photos, and safety documentation. They do not see employee names, hourly rates, internal notes, or financial data. Permission controls determine exactly what external stakeholders can access.

---

**Can residents see internal crew coordination?**

No. Residents see progress percentage per elevation, photo galleries, upcoming schedules, and expected completion dates. They do not see employee assignments, labor costs, performance metrics, or internal communications.

---

**What happens to data when a project completes?**

Completed projects archive automatically but remain searchable forever. Historical data stays available for future quoting and analytics. Projects are soft-deleted (marked inactive) rather than permanently removed, preserving payroll records and audit trails required for compliance.

---

**Can I track multiple job types on the same building?**

Yes. Create separate projects for each job type. Tower C Window Cleaning (drop-based) and Tower C Balcony Repairs (hours-based) run as two projects. Crews can work both simultaneously with sessions logged separately.

---

**What if weather delays a project?**

Click the project and change the dates. Calendar entries update automatically. Building managers and residents see the revised timeline. Add internal notes documenting the delay reason for your records.

---

**How does piece work mode calculate pay?**

Enable piece work when creating a drop-based project. Set rate per drop. When technicians log drops, the system multiplies drops by rate. 20 drops at $8 equals $160 for that session. Payroll pulls the calculated amount automatically.

---

**Can employees edit their own work sessions?**

Permission controls restrict who can edit what. Technicians log work for assigned projects only. Editing past sessions requires supervisor or manager permissions. Rates stay locked to designated managers. Complete audit trail of any changes.

---

**What if two employees enter completion percentage on the same day?**

For hours-based projects, once one employee enters completion percentage for that day, the option does not appear for the second employee until the next work session. Prevents duplicate percentage entries that would show false progress.

---

**How do I find a project from six months ago?**

Search past projects by building name, job type, date range, assigned employees, or completion status. Analytics show average performance metrics for filtered results. "Similar projects: 15-20 story window washes averaged 9.3 days, 2.4 techs, 4.1 drops per day."

---

---

## Design Notes

**Visual priorities:**
1. 4-elevation progress visualization (key differentiator, show N/E/S/W with different completion percentages)
2. Dashboard screenshot showing multiple active projects with progress bars
3. Mobile app showing technician view of daily target and schedule
4. Calendar view with color-coded multi-day project bars
5. Before/after: cluttered whiteboard + spreadsheet vs. clean dashboard

**Tone:**
Direct, competent, slightly informal. Speaking to operators exhausted by chaos who want tools that match how rope access actually works. Not corporate. Not generic SaaS. Industry insider who gets it.

**Avoid:**
- Generic "powerful" or "robust" language
- Stock imagery of people in hardhats
- Feature lists without context
- Em-dashes anywhere
- Passive voice
- "We" language (use "you" throughout)
