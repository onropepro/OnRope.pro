## Below Hero: Universal Social Proof

**Section Header:**
> Built by Rope Access. For Rope Access.

**Copy:**
> OnRopePro was created by a Level 3 IRATA technician who spent years watching good companies drown in administrative chaos. Every feature exists because rope access operators asked for it. Every workflow was tested on actual job sites. This isn't adapted HR software. It's the system we wished existed when we were running crews.

---

## Problem/Solution Section (Scrolls into view after hero)

**Section Header:**
> **The Problem With How You're Running Things Now**

---

### Column 1: The Chaos

**Subheader:** Where Your Time Actually Goes

**List:**
- 6-10 hours/week processing payroll from scattered timesheets
- 45+ minutes finding documents when building managers ask
- 2-3 hours per quote because you're guessing at historical costs
- Endless text threads tracking who's where and when
- Spreadsheets for certifications that nobody actually updates
- Paper inspection forms that live in filing cabinets (maybe)

**Kicker:**
> You started a rope access company to do rope access. Not data entry.

---

### Column 2: The Leaks

**Subheader:** Money Disappearing Every Month

**List:**
- **$1,200-3,600/year** in payroll calculation errors
- **$12,600+/year** in unbilled hours (forgot to log, disputed, lost)
- **$5,000-15,000/year** from underbid quotes (no historical data)
- **$2,000-4,000/year** in lost or untracked equipment
- **10-20% higher insurance** because you can't document your safety program

**Kicker:**
> Total: **$22,000-45,000/year** in preventable losses.

---

### Column 3: The Fix

**Subheader:** One Platform. Everything Connected.

**List:**
- Payroll prep in 30-45 minutes (not 6-10 hours)
- Every document searchable and exportable in seconds
- Historical job costing per building eliminates underbidding
- Scheduling, time tracking, and projects—all linked
- Equipment inventory with service life alerts
- Safety documentation that impresses building managers

**Kicker:**
> OnRopePro costs $99/month + $34.95/tech. The leaks you're plugging are worth 10x that.

## Design & UX Notes

### Segment Selector Behavior

1. **Default state:** "Rope Access Company" is pre-selected (primary audience)
2. **Click behavior:** Selected button highlights, reveals segment-specific hero content
3. **Scroll behavior:** Segment-specific content animates into view; rest of page is universal
4. **Mobile:** Stack buttons vertically or use dropdown

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Hero:** Large, bold. Selector prominent. Minimal clutter.
2. **Segment content:** Appears below selector. Three-column value pillars.
3. **Problem/Solution:** Three-column comparison. Scannable.
4. **Features:** 4×4 grid with icons. Module names bold.
5. **ROI:** Big numbers. Tables that speak for themselves.
6. **CTAs:** Repeated at hero, after features, and at bottom.

### Copy Principles Applied

- **Clarity = Conversion:** No jargon without context. Every benefit quantified.
- **Identity-first:** "Built by a Level 3" appears early and often.
- **Loss aversion:** Money leaks section before features.
- **Anchoring:** "$34.95 = 1 hour of 1 tech" reframes price perception.
- **Risk reversal:** Free trial, no contract, no credit card—everywhere.
- **You, not we:** Copy focuses on their problems, their outcomes.

### A/B Test Recommendations

1. **Selector vs. Tabs:** Test horizontal button row vs. tabbed interface
2. **Pre-selection:** Test "Rope Access Company" pre-selected vs. no default
3. **Hero headline:** "One Platform. Every Stakeholder." vs. "Stop Chasing Your Business."
4. **Problem section:** Three columns vs. single scrolling timeline
5. **CTA copy:** "Start Free Trial" vs. "See It In Action"

---

## Segment-Specific Landing Pages (Optional Extensions)

For SEO and ad targeting, consider dedicated landing pages:

- `/employers` → Expanded employer content
- `/technicians` → Tech-focused features and benefits
- `/property-managers` → Vendor compliance and CSR deep dive
- `/building-managers` → Resident portal and coordination benefits
- `/residents` → Simple portal overview

Each page would expand on the segment-specific hero content with additional proof points and use cases.

---

## Mobile Considerations

1. **Hero:** Headline, subheadline, and segment selector visible without scrolling
2. **Selector:** Horizontal scroll or dropdown on small screens
3. **Value pillars:** Stack vertically on mobile
4. **Feature grid:** 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablet
5. **CTAs:** Sticky "Start Free Trial" button on mobile scroll

**Document End**

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**

| Framework | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Simplicity** (Made to Stick) | Core message in 7 words: "One Platform. Every Stakeholder. Zero Chaos." |

| **Social Proof** | Trust section establishes credibility without fake testimonials |
| **Risk Elimination** | Free trial, no contract, no credit card—repeated |
| **Modularity of Mind** | Segment selector creates instant mental category for each audience |
| **Curiosity Gap** | "The leaks you can't see" creates desire to scroll |
| **Concreteness** | Every benefit has a number (87-93%, 22+ hours, $22K-45K) |
