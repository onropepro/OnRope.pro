# OnRopePro Technician Landing Page
## Target: Urban Rope Technicians (Career Climbers, Multi-Employer Hustlers, Freedom Seekers)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**Strategy:** Clarity = Conversion | Tech-first registration | PLUS upgrade via referral  
**Psychological Frameworks:** Loss Aversion, Identity-Based Ownership, Social Proof, Endowment Effect, Reciprocal Altruism

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware to Solution-aware
- They know logbook chaos is a problem
- They know onboarding friction costs them money
- They may not know a solution exists

**Core Insight:** Urban rope techs treat their work history like currency—but they store it in systems they don't own. When employers fold or they switch jobs, years of logged hours vanish.

**Emotional Territory:** Security through ownership. Professional identity validation.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Loss Aversion** - "You've lost hours. You just don't know it yet."
2. **Endowment Effect** - "Your hours. Your proof. Forever."
3. **Identity-Based Habits** - You're not just a tech; you're building a portable professional identity
4. **Social Proof** - Peer techs using this successfully
5. **Reciprocal Altruism** - Refer a friend, both unlock PLUS

## HERO SECTION

### Primary Headline
**Your Hours. Your Proof. Forever.**

### Subheadline
The portable work passport for rope access technicians. Every building. Every drop. Every hour—logged, protected, and owned by you.

### CTA Button

### Supporting Visual

## PROBLEM VALIDATION SECTION

### Section Header
**You've lost hours. You just don't know how many.**

### Body Copy
Last Tuesday. That 40-story building downtown. Did you do 3 drops or 4?

Three weeks ago. The industrial complex out by the port. Was it 6 hours or 8?

Six months ago. The company that folded. All those hours—gone with their paperwork.

You're not careless. You're busy hitting 5 buildings a week, managing gear, staying safe at height. Details blur. Memory fails. And when you sit down to fill your IRATA logbook, you're guessing at the data your certification depends on.

**The industry average: 15-20% of logged hours are estimates, not records.**

That's your career progression. Your L2. Your L3. Built on guesswork.

---

## VALUE PROPOSITION SECTION

### Section Header
**One account. Every employer. Your entire career.**

### Body Copy
OnRopePro gives you something the industry has never offered: a professional identity you actually own.

Not locked in your employer's filing cabinet. Not lost when companies fold. Not starting from zero every time you change jobs.

Your IRATA or SPRAT number becomes your permanent identifier. Your work history accumulates automatically. Your professional reputation travels with you—Vancouver to Toronto to Seattle and back.

**When you create a tech account, you're not signing up for software. You're building a portable professional identity that gains value with every logged hour.**

## SEGMENT-SPECIFIC VALUE BLOCKS

---

### FOR CAREER CLIMBERS
**"I need 1,000 hours for L2. I think I'm at 850. Maybe 1,050. I don't actually know."**

#### The Problem
Your L2 depends on accurate hours. Your L3 depends on accurate hours. Your entire progression from $35/hour to $75/hour depends on documentation you're reconstructing from memory.

43% of techs have had certification issues tied to incomplete logbook records. One assessor flag. One rejected application. Months of wasted time.

#### The Solution
Every drop. Every building. Every hour. Logged automatically, timestamped, and exportable. When you sit down to fill your physical IRATA logbook—which you still need to do—you're copying accurate data instead of guessing.

**You still keep your physical logbook. That's required. OnRopePro just makes sure what goes in it is right.**

"I passed my L2 audit with 1,247 documented hours. Every single one of them verified in my export."  
**— Jake M., L2 IRATA, Vancouver**

**Your certification. Your data. Your protection.**

→ **Create Free Account**

### FOR MULTI-EMPLOYER HUSTLERS
**"I work for 3 companies. That's 3 timesheets, 3 sets of paperwork, 3 logins. Every week."**

#### The Problem
You've built a portfolio career—main employer plus side gigs, maximizing your hourly rate. Smart. But every employer means separate onboarding, separate paperwork, and no unified view of your total hours, total income, or total career progression.

You're losing 4-6 hours per month to administrative chaos. At $50/hour, that's $3,000/year in unpaid time.

#### The Solution
One profile. Multiple employer connections. Each employer sees what you share—nothing more, nothing less. Hours logged separately by company. Your aggregate career data always accessible.

No more re-entering banking info. No more re-uploading certifications. No more starting from scratch.

**PLUS accounts connect to unlimited employers. One referral unlocks it.**

"I added my third employer in 10 seconds. Same profile, same certifications, separate time tracking."  
**— Marcus C., L3 IRATA, Toronto**

→ **Create Free Account | Upgrade to PLUS with 1 Referral**

---

### FOR FREEDOM SEEKERS
**"I worked Vancouver, Calgary, and Seattle this year. Every job = starting from zero credibility."**

#### The Problem
You're not flaky. You're mobile. But every new city means proving yourself again. References 2,000 miles away. No local reputation. Three hours of paperwork before your first shift.

You need to start earning NOW, not after a week of bureaucratic onboarding.

#### The Solution
Your professional identity travels with you. Your work history from Vancouver? Visible in Seattle. Your certifications? Pre-verified. Your safety rating? Proof you're reliable before you even show up.

Quit Friday in one city. Start Monday in another. Zero paperwork.

"I showed up in Toronto with nothing but my gear and my OnRopePro profile. Started working that afternoon."  
**— Lena B., L2 IRATA, Nomadic**

**Your passport. Not your employer's property.**

## HOW IT WORKS

### Section Header
**30 seconds to set up. 10 years of protected career data.**

### Step 1: Create Your Account
Enter your IRATA or SPRAT license number. Add your certifications. Upload your photo. Done.

### Step 2: Connect With Employers
When you join a company using OnRopePro, they send an invitation. Accept it. Your profile populates their system instantly. No forms. No redundant data entry.

### Step 3: Work. Everything Logs Automatically.
When connected to an employer on OnRopePro, every work session captures: date, building, height, tasks, duration. Grouped by project. Totaled by month and year.

### Step 4: Export and Fill Your Physical Logbook
Download your complete work history as PDF or CSV. Transfer accurate data into your physical IRATA/SPRAT logbook. Your assessor still checks your physical book—OnRopePro just makes sure the data in it is correct.

**Note:** Your account works even without an employer on the platform. You can store certifications, track history manually, and access the job board (PLUS). But when your employer also uses OnRopePro? Everything supercharges—automatic hour tracking, instant onboarding, seamless documentation.

**Tell your boss to check it out. You both win.**

## IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS

### ⚠️ THIS DOES NOT REPLACE YOUR PHYSICAL LOGBOOK ⚠️
**Your IRATA/SPRAT physical logbook is still required.** OnRopePro is a digital assistant that gives you accurate data to transfer into your official logbook—it does not replace it.

IRATA and SPRAT certification bodies require you to maintain your physical logbook. That requirement hasn't changed. What has changed is how accurate your entries can be.

**Think of it this way:**
- **Before:** You guess at hours and details when filling your logbook weeks later
- **After:** You copy precise, timestamped data from OnRopePro into your logbook

Your assessor still checks your physical book. OnRopePro just makes sure the data in that book is right.

### Your data. Your control.
- Export anytime. No lock-in.
- Delete your account anytime. Your data goes with you.
- Employers see only what you choose to share.
- Your SIN is optional. Refusing won't limit your account.

### Security
Banking details and sensitive data encrypted using AES-256-GCM. SOC2 Type II compliant. PIPEDA compliant.

## THE PLUS UPGRADE PATH

### Section Header
**Unlock PLUS. Pay nothing. Here's how.**

### Body Copy
PLUS accounts are free. Not "free trial." Not "free for 30 days." Actually free.

**How it works:**
1. Create your free account
2. Refer one other rope tech who creates an account
3. You get upgraded to PLUS automatically

That's it. One referral. Lifetime PLUS access for you.

### Why we do this
Technicians ARE the network. The more techs on OnRopePro, the more employers adopt it. The more employers adopt it, the more valuable your profile becomes.

You're not the product. You're the reason the platform exists.

## FINAL CTA SECTION

### Section Header
**Your hours outlive your employer.**

### Body Copy
Companies fold. Supervisors quit. Paper gets lost. Spreadsheets corrupt.

But your career investment—the 500, 1,000, 2,000 hours you've worked at height—that should never disappear.

Create your account. Start building your portable professional identity. It's free. It's yours. Forever.

### CTA Button

### Sub-CTA

## FAQ SECTION

### Is the tech account really free?
Yes. Free forever. No credit card required. No time limits. No feature restrictions that suddenly lock you out.

### What if my employer doesn't use OnRopePro?
Your account still works. You can store certifications, track your career history manually, and access the job board (PLUS). Automatic hour tracking kicks in when your employer joins the platform.

### Does this replace my IRATA/SPRAT logbook?
**No. You still need your physical logbook.** IRATA and SPRAT require it. Your assessor will check it. OnRopePro is a digital assistant that captures accurate data so you can fill your physical logbook correctly—not a replacement for it.

### What happens to my data if I leave a company?
Your profile (certifications, work history, safety rating) stays with you permanently. Company-specific data (assigned gear, company documents) stays with that employer. Your core identity is always yours.

### How do I get PLUS?
Refer one other technician who creates an account. You both get upgraded to PLUS automatically. No payment required.

### Is my data secure?
AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive data. SOC2 Type II compliant infrastructure. PIPEDA compliant (Canada). Your SIN is completely optional.

### Can employers see that I'm looking for other work?
No. Your job board activity is private. Employers see only what you explicitly share with them.
