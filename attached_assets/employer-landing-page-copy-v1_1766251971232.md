**Target Audience:** Rope Access Company Owners (Employers)

## Strategic Foundation

### Target Audience Awareness Stage
**Solution-Aware to Product-Aware**

These owners know their operations are chaotic. They've tried spreadsheets, paper forms, and text chains. They may have tried generic software that "didn't fit." They're looking for something built for rope access, not adapted from construction.

### Core Insight
Rope access company owners started their businesses to do things the right way. They escaped employers who cut corners on safety. But now they're drowning in the same administrative chaos they swore they'd fix. The spreadsheets multiply. The text threads never stop. The payroll errors cost money and trust. They've become the paper-shuffling managers they never wanted to be.

### Psychological Frameworks Used
1. **Loss Aversion** - Protect your hours, protect your money, protect your technicians
2. **Identity-Based Habits** - Professional operations use professional systems (you do things right)
3. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - Replace 5-10 scattered tools with one system that connects everything
4. **Autonomy & Control** - Work ON your business, not IN the spreadsheets
5. **Commitment/Consistency** - You started this company to do things right. This helps you prove it.

### Emotional Territory
- **Primary:** Relief (from chaos)
- **Secondary:** Control (of operations)
- **Tertiary:** Pride (professional operations)

### Formula
PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) with Before-After-Bridge for transformation sections

## The Problem (Agitation Section)

### Section Header
**You Didn't Start Your Company to Wrestle Spreadsheets.**

### Body Copy

You spent years on the ropes. You saw companies cut corners. You decided to do things the right way.

Now you're running a business. And "the right way" means 8 hours wrestling payroll every two weeks. It means texts from crew at 6 AM asking which building they're working. It means paper safety forms in a filing cabinet you haven't touched since the last audit.

You track hours in one spreadsheet. Projects in another. Drop counts in a third. Complaints come through email, text, and phone calls from building managers who want updates you don't have time to give.

Your supervisor accidentally sees what your Level 3 lead makes. A technician disputes his hours. You find out your last job lost money three weeks after it finished.

This isn't what you signed up for.

You started this company to run quality operations, not to become an admin nightmare. To protect your crew, not to spend Sundays fixing payroll. To build something, not to chase paper.

OnRopePro gives you that back.

## What OnRopePro Does

### Section Header
**One Connected System for Everything Your Company Does**

### Intro Copy
OnRopePro replaces 5-10 scattered tools with one platform where projects, hours, safety, and communication connect automatically. What you enter once flows everywhere it needs to go.

### Card 1: Track Every Project in One Place

Manage 10-20 concurrent jobs from a single dashboard. See which elevations are complete. Know if you're on budget before the job ends. Access every past project for repeat quotes.

**What gets tracked:**
- 4-elevation progress (North, East, South, West)
- Parkade stalls, in-suite units, ground-level work
- Hours logged against each project
- Photos, complaints, and safety documentation
- Budget vs. actual in real-time

### Card 2: Eliminate Payroll Chaos

Clock in/out from smartphones. Hours flow directly to payroll. Rates stay locked. Disputes disappear. Export to QuickBooks, ADP, or any payroll system.

**What gets tracked:**
- Billable and non-billable hours with one tap
- Individual rates per technician (fully customizable)
- Overtime calculations (configurable thresholds)
- Complete audit trail for every session
- Gross pay calculations per pay period

### Card 3: Prove Your Safety Culture

Digital toolbox meetings with signatures. Equipment inspections with photos. IRATA logbook hour tracking. Complete documentation for audits, insurance, and clients who need to see you do things right.

**What gets tracked:**
- Daily equipment inspections with pass/fail
- Toolbox meeting attendance and topics
- Hazard identification with photos
- IRATA/SPRAT logbook hours
- Exportable PDF reports for compliance

## How Everything Connects

### Section Header
**Every Module Talks to Every Other Module**

### Intro Copy
This isn't 16 separate tools. It's one system. Data flows automatically between modules, eliminating double-entry and connecting your operations in ways spreadsheets never could.

### Connection Examples

**Work Sessions → Projects → Payroll**
Technician clocks in at Building A. Hours appear on Project A's budget. When you run payroll, those hours are already there. No spreadsheet reconciliation. No disputes.

**Complaints → Projects → Residents**
Resident submits complaint with photo. Crew lead sees it on their project dashboard. Resolution notes visible to resident. Building manager sees you handled it in 24 hours, not 3 days.

**Employees → Permissions → Everything**
You set permission levels once. Your supervisor sees project progress but not pay rates. Your technicians log drops but can't edit budgets. Financial data stays with people who need it.

**Equipment → Safety → Audits**
Harness inspection logged with photo. That record connects to the technician who used it, the project they worked, and the date. IRATA auditor asks for 6 months of inspections? Export a PDF in 10 seconds.

## For Employers (Primary Buyer)

### Section Header
**Built for How You Actually Run Your Business**

### Benefit 1: Stop Losing Money to Payroll Errors

A $1,200 payroll mistake happens once and you don't notice. It happens again. By month six, you've lost $7,000+ to spreadsheet errors and hour disputes. OnRopePro captures exact hours, applies exact rates, and gives you audit-ready records that eliminate "I swear I worked 9 hours" conversations.

**Result:** 87-93% reduction in payroll processing time. Zero hour disputes.

### Benefit 2: Know Which Jobs Make Money Before They End

Your last job lost money. You found out three weeks after the crew packed up. With OnRopePro, you see labor costs accumulating in real-time. Budget alerts fire when you're trending over. Historical cost-per-drop data makes your next quote accurate, not hopeful.

**Result:** 15-20% improvement in quote accuracy. Early warning on over-budget jobs.

### Benefit 3: Prove Your Safety Culture to Anyone Who Asks

Insurance auditor wants toolbox meeting records. IRATA assessor needs equipment inspections. Client RFP requires safety documentation. You open OnRopePro, export PDFs, and send them. The paper filing cabinet stays closed.

**Result:** 10-20% insurance premium savings from documented safety culture.

### Benefit 4: Stop Being the Middleman on Every Complaint

Resident calls the building manager. Building manager calls you. You call your crew lead. Three days later, someone remembers to close the loop. With OnRopePro's resident portal, complaints go directly to your team. Resolution notes are visible to residents. Building managers see you're responsive without a single phone call.

**Result:** 70% reduction in service calls. 24-hour resolution vs. 3-day phone tag.

### Benefit 5: Control Who Sees What

Your supervisor needs project access but shouldn't see everyone's pay rates. Your Level 3 lead can approve sessions but can't edit budgets. OnRopePro's 44 individual permissions let you grant exactly the access each role requires. Financial privacy stays intact.

**Result:** Complete control without micromanagement.

## The Numbers That Matter

### Payroll Time Savings
**From 4-8 hours to 30 minutes per pay period.**
That's 7+ hours back every two weeks. 182 hours per year. Time you can spend on operations, sales, or your family.

### Quote Accuracy
**15-20% fewer money-losing bids.**
Historical cost-per-drop data replaces guesswork. You know what that building actually costs before you submit the quote.

### Resident Communication
**70% fewer phone calls from residents and building managers.**
Self-service complaint submission with real-time status. Residents see progress. Managers see responsiveness. Your phone stays quiet.

### Audit Readiness
**Complete documentation in 10 seconds, not 10 hours.**
Equipment inspections. Toolbox meetings. Work sessions. All searchable, all exportable, all proving you do things the right way.

## For Your Technicians

### Section Header
**They Just Want to Log Drops and Go Home**

Your crew doesn't want another app. They want simple. OnRopePro gives them:

**One-Tap Clock In/Out**
Start day. End day. Switch projects. That's it.

**Drop Logging That Remembers Their Building**
Select project once. Log drops for the rest of the day. No re-entering building details.

**Their Hours, Verified**
They see their logged hours. You see them verified. No "I swear I worked 9 hours" because everything's timestamped.

**Portable Career Record**
IRATA logbook hours tracked automatically. Certification reminders before they expire. A professional profile that travels with them (if they ever leave).

---

## For Building Managers

### Section Header
**Give Them Visibility Without Giving Them Your Time**

Building managers need to know work is progressing. They need documentation for their boards. They need to verify your crew is qualified. OnRopePro gives them all of this without a single phone call from you.

**Vendor Verification**
Managers can verify your company is on the platform, check certifications, and see safety ratings before work begins.

**Progress Visibility**
Real-time project status. Photos. Completion percentages. They see the work happening without asking you for updates.

**Complaint Resolution**
When residents submit complaints, managers see they're being handled. Your responsiveness becomes visible evidence.

**Documentation on Demand**
COI verification. Safety records. Project history. Available when they need it, exported when they request it.

---

## For Residents

### Section Header
**Happy Residents. Quiet Phone.**

Your residents want to know when you're cleaning their windows, report problems when they happen, and see that issues get resolved. OnRopePro's resident portal handles all three.

**Self-Service Registration**
Residents register with a building code. No admin work from you.

**Progress Visibility**
They see the 4-elevation display. They know which side of the building you're working. They stop calling to ask.

**Direct Complaint Submission**
Photo. Description. Unit number. Submitted. They don't call the building manager. They don't escalate. They submit and watch for resolution.

**Result:** Residents become advocates instead of complainers. Building managers see your responsiveness. Contract renewals get easier.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Set Up Your Company (30 minutes)

Create your account. Add your technicians with roles and rates. Set permissions. Import your active buildings.

### Step 2: Your Team Starts Using It (Day 1)

Technicians download the app. Clock in. Log drops. Clock out. Supervisors create projects. Add progress notes. Attach photos.

### Step 3: Everything Connects Automatically

Hours appear on projects. Projects show budget vs. actual. Payroll calculates from sessions. Complaints link to projects. Safety docs build audit trails. You stop reconciling spreadsheets.

### Step 4: You Run Your Business

Weekly dashboard checks instead of daily firefighting. Payroll in 30 minutes instead of 8 hours. Quotes based on data instead of memory. Time to focus on operations, sales, and growth.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does setup take?**
Most companies are operational within 30 minutes. Add your buildings, add your team, set permissions. Your technicians can start logging work on day one.

**Does my crew need special phones or equipment?**
Any smartphone with a browser works. iPhone, Android, tablets. No app store download required (though one is available). Works offline with sync when reconnected.

**Can I control who sees financial data?**
Yes. 44 individual permissions. Your supervisor can create projects without seeing pay rates. Your technicians can log hours without editing budgets. You control exactly who sees what.

**What happens if a technician leaves?**
Deactivate their account. Their historical data stays (for audits and records). Their seat opens for the next hire. No data loss.

**How does pricing work as we grow?**
$99 base + $34.95 per active technician. Add team members anytime. Remove them when you need to. Seasonal adjustments are built in.

**Can building managers see our internal data?**
No. They see project progress, completion status, and complaint resolution. They don't see your labor costs, rates, or internal notes. Privacy by design.

**Does this integrate with QuickBooks?**
Payroll exports to CSV for any payroll system. Direct QuickBooks integration is available as a premium add-on.

**What about IRATA certification tracking?**
The platform tracks IRATA and SPRAT certification levels, alerts before expiration, and maintains logbook hours automatically as work sessions are logged.

HTTPS encryption, bcrypt password hashing, complete tenant isolation (your data is completely separate from other companies), role-based access controls, and regular backups.
