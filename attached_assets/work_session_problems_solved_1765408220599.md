## ✅ Problems Solved (Customer-Focused)

### For Rope Access Company Owners

---

#### Problem 1: "I have no idea how many hours my guys spent driving around versus actually working"

**The Pain:**
You pay your crew for 40 hours but have no visibility into how much time they spent on revenue-generating work versus running errands, picking up supplies, or waiting around. At the end of the month, you see labor costs but can't distinguish productive time from overhead. Your profitability per project is a guess.

**Real Example:**
You completed a building wash that was quoted at 80 labor hours. Payroll shows you paid for 95 hours. Where did the extra 15 hours go? Was it legitimate travel time? Did someone spend a full day retrieving forgotten equipment? You'll never know—so you can't prevent it next time.

**The Solution:**
Non-billable hours are tracked separately with automatic categorization. When employees clock in, they select either a project (billable) or non-billable category (training, travel, errands, meetings). The dashboard shows your billable vs non-billable ratio by week, month, and year—giving you clear visibility into labor efficiency.

**The Benefit:**
Accurate cost of goods sold for every project. Identify patterns in non-productive time. Make informed decisions about logistics and scheduling to minimize overhead.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 121-125):**
> "Go ask Jeff tomorrow. How many hours were the guys driving around, moving gear from one building to another, picking up soap for another guy, bringing a piece of gear someone forgot at the shop? No clue. He wouldn't even know."

---

#### Problem 2: "Every day I'm calling my techs asking where they're at on the building"

**The Pain:**
You have 5 projects running simultaneously and zero real-time visibility into progress. You call each tech individually, they give vague answers based on memory, you try to piece together where things stand. You're spending 2-3 hours daily just figuring out what's happening across your jobs. And when a client calls asking for a status update, you're guessing.

**Real Example:**
It's Tuesday afternoon. Client calls: "Will you finish by Friday? We have painters coming Monday." You have no idea. You call Tommy. He doesn't answer. You text. Wait 20 minutes for a response. "Maybe? Depends on weather tomorrow." You call the client back with a non-answer. They lose confidence in your operation.

**The Solution:**
End-of-day forms automatically capture drops completed, completion percentages, and shortfall reasons. Project dashboards update in real-time as work sessions close. You see exactly where every project stands without making a single phone call.

**The Benefit:**
Eliminate 90% of status-check phone calls. Know instantly if a project is on track or falling behind—and why. Give clients confident, accurate answers immediately. Your operation appears professional and organized.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 148-153):**
> "There is not a day that goes by that Jeff doesn't call one person per project to see where they're at or text them... Probably 90 of his phone calls are with the techs being like, when will you be done? Where are you at? Why is this not done?"

---

#### Problem 3: "The building went 20 hours over budget and I don't really know why"

**The Pain:**
A project finishes, you're way over labor budget, and you can't reconstruct what happened. Was it weather delays? Underperforming workers? A bad estimate from the start? The crew gives vague explanations that contradict each other. You move on to the next job never learning from the loss.

**Real Example:**
You quoted 120 hours for a window wash. Final payroll: 145 hours. You lost $3,000 in margin. When you ask the crew, you get: "It was windy a few days," "Tommy was slow," "The building access was harder than expected." All of these might be true. None of them are documented. Next year, you'll quote this building again with the same bad data.

**The Solution:**
Every work session logs hours worked, drops completed, and shortfall reasons. If a technician misses their daily target, they must explain why before closing the session. Weather delays, equipment issues, building access problems—all captured and timestamped. Project analytics show exactly where time was spent.

**The Benefit:**
Data-driven post-mortems. Next year, you can look back and say "this building took 145 hours last time, but 18 hours were weather delays and 7 hours were access issues—so our quote for ideal conditions should be 120 hours, but we should pad 15-20% for contingencies."

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 58-61):**
> "At the end of the building, you're just pissed off because your building went 20 hours over budget and you don't really know why. You know it was wetter. You know the guy was not feeling well someday. You don't really know. Move on. Next building."

---

#### Problem 4: "One tech is crushing it while another coasts—and I can't prove it"

**The Pain:**
Your gut says Tommy completes 5 drops per day while another employee barely does 2. They work the same hours, you pay them the same, but productivity is wildly different. Without data, you can't have the coaching conversation. You suspect someone's on their phone half the day, but proving it means physical surveillance—awkward and time-consuming.

**Real Example:**
Two techs worked the same 8-hour shift at the same building. Tommy logged 6 drops. The other guy logged 2. But without a system, all you see is two timesheets for 8 hours each. You're paying double wages for 8 drops of work that Tommy could have done alone. The high performer is demoralized watching his coworker coast.

**The Solution:**
Per-employee performance tracking shows drops/units completed per shift, target achievement rates, and historical trends. End-of-day shortfall prompts ensure accountability—if they don't meet their target, they must explain why. No more hiding behind "I worked my 8 hours."

**The Benefit:**
Objective performance data for coaching conversations. High performers feel recognized (lower turnover). Underperformers either improve or self-select out. Clients see faster project completion. You stop overpaying for underperformance.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 155-156):**
> "Now it's just like, why didn't you do your drops? Well, look on OnRopePro, it's all there, it's all explained. Oh, okay, thanks."

---

#### Problem 5: "My guys clock in from the coffee shop and I'd never know"

**The Pain:**
You trust your crew, but you've heard stories. An employee clocks in at 8:00 AM from home, drives to the job site, starts work at 8:45. They clock out at 4:30 from the building, but actually left at 4:00 to beat traffic. Over a year, that's hundreds of hours of phantom payroll.

**Real Example:**
You notice one technician always logs exactly 8.0 hours—never 7.9, never 8.1. Perfect round numbers every day. Something feels off. But without location data, you have no way to verify they were actually at the building for those 8 hours.

**The Solution:**
GPS coordinates are captured at clock-in and clock-out. You can see exactly where the employee was when they started and ended their session. The pins appear on a map—either at the building address or somewhere else entirely.

**The Benefit:**
Eliminates timesheet fraud without micromanaging. Honest employees aren't affected—they clock in at the job site like they always did. Dishonest employees are caught or self-correct knowing their location is logged. Trust is verified, not assumed.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 105-107):**
> "The GPS pins point them on a map. So you can see that the guy actually clocked in at the building and not at the boss's place half hour earlier. Same for clock out."

---

#### Problem 6: "I pay people by the drop but tracking it is a nightmare"

**The Pain:**
Some projects use piece work—pay per drop instead of hourly. This incentivizes productivity but creates accounting chaos. You're manually reconciling drop counts from texts and phone calls with timesheets, calculating compensation for each tech, and hoping you didn't miss anything. One mistake and payroll is wrong.

**Real Example:**
Black Ties pays $70 per drop. Building budget: 100 drops, $7,000 labor. Tommy did 3 buildings this week, different drop rates on each. You're doing math in a spreadsheet, cross-referencing his texts ("did 8 drops today"), and praying it adds up. It takes 2 hours per week just for one employee's piece work reconciliation.

**The Solution:**
Toggle "Piece Work" on any project and set the price per drop. When employees end their session and enter drops completed, payroll automatically calculates: 3 drops × $70/drop = $210. The entry is marked as piece work in payroll reporting, separate from hourly wages.

**The Benefit:**
Zero manual calculation. Piece work and hourly employees can work the same project—system handles both. Payroll exports are accurate automatically. You reclaim 2-4 hours per week spent on piece work reconciliation.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 133-141):**
> "Piece work is... some companies pay per drop. They'll have a budget, let's say $10,000 for a building. They allow $6,000 for the guys. So that $6,000 is spread into drops. If you scroll around on Facebook all day and do one drop, you get paid for one drop."

---

#### Problem 7: "Payroll takes forever because I'm deciphering texts and timesheets"

**The Pain:**
Every pay period, you're collecting timesheets from paper forms, text messages, emails, and memory. Then you're entering it all into payroll manually. Overtime calculations happen in your head. Mistakes happen. An employee complains, you have to dig through records to verify. The whole process takes 6-10 hours for a 15-person crew.

**Real Example:**
Tommy texts "worked 9.5 hours Tuesday, building was rough." Sarah's paper timesheet says "8 hours Monday, 10 hours Wednesday." You have three texts you can't find, one timesheet that's illegible, and Friday's hours aren't submitted yet. Payroll is due in 2 hours.

**The Solution:**
Work sessions are logged in real-time with automatic overtime calculation. The system tracks regular hours (0-8), overtime hours (8-12), and double-time hours (12+) based on your company's rules. Payroll page shows a complete breakdown for each employee—exportable in one click.

**The Benefit:**
Payroll processing time reduced by 87-93%. Overtime calculated automatically. No more chasing employees for missing timesheets. No more manual data entry errors. Export to your payroll provider in seconds.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 201-205):**
> "When a session ends, the system calculates hour breakdown based on company settings... Daily triggers overtime, double time per day."

### For Rope Access Technicians

#### Problem 8: "I forgot to fill out my logbook and now I can't remember what tasks I did"

**The Pain:**
IRATA and SPRAT certifications require detailed task logging—hours spent on rope transfers, rescues, ascending, rigging, etc. You're supposed to log these daily, but life gets busy. Two months later, you're filling out your logbook from memory, guessing what days you did rope transfers versus re-anchors. Inaccurate logs can affect your certification progression.

**Real Example:**
Your IRATA recertification is in 3 weeks. You open your logbook—last entry was 6 months ago. You've done hundreds of hours of rope work since then. You try to reconstruct from memory, but days blur together. You guess at task breakdowns and hope the assessor doesn't ask detailed questions.

**The Solution:**
After ending each work session, you're prompted to log your IRATA/SPRAT task hours by category (20+ task types available). This data accumulates in your profile. When it's time to update your official logbook, you have a detailed record of exactly what tasks you performed and when.

**The Benefit:**
Accurate certification tracking without daily logbook discipline. Your logged hours are always current. Recertification prep takes 30 minutes instead of 3 hours of guessing.

**⚠️ Important Note:**
OnRopePro's IRATA/SPRAT logging is NOT certification-approved. It's a personal tracking tool to help you fill your official logbook accurately. Future integration with certification bodies is planned.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 233-240):**
> "Right now this is just a tool to help them fill their logbook... Potentially in the future we will be hopefully connected to IRATA and SPRAT so that this becomes an approved method of tracking and logging."

#### Problem 9: "My boss thinks I'm slacking when I legitimately couldn't hit target"

**The Pain:**
You're evaluated on drops per day, but some days are impossible. Wind picks up at noon, you lose half the afternoon. Building access gets blocked for 2 hours. Another trade is on the roof. You hit 2 drops instead of your 4-drop target. Without documentation, it looks like you underperformed.

**Real Example:**
You worked hard all day but only completed 2 of 4 target drops because wind conditions were unsafe after lunch. Your supervisor only sees "50% of target" in the report. You get a coaching conversation that feels unfair. You're demoralized.

**The Solution:**
When you don't meet your daily target, the system requires a shortfall reason before you can close your session. Weather delays, equipment issues, building access problems—all documented. Certain reasons are "performance-protected" and don't negatively impact your productivity metrics.

**The Benefit:**
Your legitimate challenges are documented, not forgotten. Weather delays don't hurt your performance score. Your supervisor sees the full picture, not just the numbers. Fair evaluation based on factors you can control.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 191-197):**
> "I could fix that easily just by adding a bunch of automatic reasons that you can select like weather delays... if one of those are selected, it will not affect their performance."

### For Operations Managers / Supervisors

#### Problem 10: "I have 15 workers across 6 sites and no idea who's where"

**The Pain:**
You're managing multiple crews across multiple buildings. Someone calls in sick, someone finishes early, someone hasn't clocked in and you don't know if they're late or just forgot. You're texting and calling trying to build a mental picture of who's where—wasting an hour every morning on logistics.

**Real Example:**
It's 9:15 AM. You see 12 of 15 workers have clocked in. Are the other 3 late? Did they forget to clock in? Are they sick and didn't notify you? You start making calls. Tommy forgot his phone at home. Sarah's stuck in traffic. Mike is actually on-site and forgot to clock in. You just spent 30 minutes on basic attendance tracking.

**The Solution:**
Real-time Active Workers dashboard shows everyone currently clocked in, which project they're working on, and when they started. Missing workers are immediately visible—you know who to follow up with.

**The Benefit:**
Attendance tracking in seconds, not 30 minutes. Know exactly who's where without phone calls. Spot problems (no-shows, late starts) immediately and respond.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 214-216):**
> "Managers can see who's currently working in real time... Real time status update."

#### Problem 11: "A tech forgot to clock out and now their hours are wrong"

**The Pain:**
Employees forget to clock out. They close the app and go home. Next morning, you see a 16-hour work session that's obviously wrong. Now you're playing detective—calling the employee, checking when they actually left, manually adjusting the record. This happens 2-3 times per week.

**Real Example:**
Tommy's session shows 15.5 hours yesterday. He definitely didn't work that long—he left around 5 PM. But the system has him clocked out at 9:30 PM. You call Tommy, he doesn't remember exactly when he left. You guess at 5:15 PM and manually adjust. You hope it's close enough.

**The Solution:**
Users with financial permissions (owners, ops managers, accounting) can edit completed sessions. Adjust start time, end time, drops completed, and billable status. The system automatically recalculates hours breakdown (regular, overtime, double-time) and payroll amounts.

**The Benefit:**
Fix clock-out errors in 30 seconds without complicated workarounds. Payroll stays accurate. No need to delete and recreate sessions.

**Validated Quote (Transcript Lines 250-257):**
> "If a tech forgets to clock out and they clock out at like 9 PM, whoever with permission can go in there and readjust and then it will adjust their hours, their pay."

### Additional Core Problems (Technical Foundation)

---

#### Inaccurate Time Records

**Problem:** Paper timesheets, text messages, and manual entry lead to errors, fraud, and disputes.  
**Solution:** Digital clock-in/clock-out with GPS verification and automatic timestamp recording. No manual data entry required.  
**Benefit:** Eliminates timesheet fraud. Reduces payroll errors by 87-93%. Creates auditable record for disputes.

---

#### Manual Hour Calculations

**Problem:** Calculating regular, overtime, and double-time hours manually for each employee each pay period.  
**Solution:** Automatic hour classification based on company-configured thresholds (8-hour day, 40-hour week, etc.). System calculates OT/DT breakdowns per session and per pay period.  
**Benefit:** Zero manual overtime calculation. Configurable rules for different employment types. Payroll-ready exports.

---

#### Missing Work Output Data

**Problem:** Hours logged but no record of what was actually accomplished. "8 hours worked" tells you nothing about productivity.  
**Solution:** End-of-day forms capture work output by job type—drops completed (N/E/S/W), units cleaned, completion percentage. Work output tied to payroll record.  
**Benefit:** Complete picture of both time and productivity. Performance analytics possible. Project progress automatically updated.

---

#### Disconnected Payroll Data

**Problem:** Time tracking in one system, payroll in another, manual data transfer between them.  
**Solution:** Work session data feeds directly into payroll calculations. Hourly employees get automatic hour/rate calculations. Piece work employees get automatic drop×rate calculations. Non-billable hours tracked separately.  
**Benefit:** Single source of truth for time and compensation. Export-ready for external payroll systems. Billable vs non-billable visibility.

---

#### No Accountability for Missed Targets

**Problem:** Employees miss daily targets with no documentation of why. Patterns of underperformance hidden in aggregate data.  
**Solution:** Mandatory shortfall reason when target not met. Protected reasons (weather, equipment, access) don't affect performance metrics. Custom reasons logged but do affect metrics.  
**Benefit:** Accountability without unfairness. Weather days documented, not held against employees. Patterns of legitimate vs questionable shortfalls visible.
