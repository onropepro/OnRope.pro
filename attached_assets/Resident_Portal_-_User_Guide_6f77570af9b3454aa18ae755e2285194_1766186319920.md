- View building progress and project updates
- See notices about upcoming work
- Submit feedback on issues (such as streaky windows, concerns, or compliments)

**Where do I get a company code?**

Your building manager or property manager can provide the company code. Usually notices will be placed in elevators or at the reception/entrance to the building.

> **Important:** Active work and building information won't appear in your control panel until you've entered the company code.
