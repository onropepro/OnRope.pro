## Value Proposition Section

### Why $34.95 Per Tech Makes Sense

**Here's the reality:**

$34.95 is what you pay a technician for **one hour of work**.

OnRopePro saves your average tech **10+ hours per month** in eliminated paperwork, duplicate onboarding, and manual time tracking.

That's a **10:1 return** before you count the bigger wins: eliminated payroll errors, recovered unbilled hours, and contracts you won because building managers saw your professional documentation.

## Social Proof Section

### Built by Rope Access. For Rope Access.

OnRopePro was built by a Level 3 technician who got tired of watching good companies drown in paperwork.

Every feature exists because rope access operators asked for it. Every workflow was tested on actual job sites.

This isn't adapted HR software. It's not a generic "field service" platform with rope access sprinkled on top.

**It's the system we wished existed when we were running crews.**

---

## Objection Handling Section

### Questions You're Probably Asking

**"What if my techs won't use it?"**

They will. The mobile interface is built for gloved hands and bright sunlight. Clock in with two taps. Log hours in 30 seconds. Techs who've used it say it's faster than texting their hours.

**"What about my existing data?"**

We help you import employees, buildings, and equipment. Most companies are fully operational within a week.

**"What if I need to cancel?"**

Monthly billing. Cancel anytime. No contracts. No cancellation fees. We'd rather earn your business every month than trap you in a contract.

**"Is my data secure?"**

Bank-level encryption. SOC 2 compliant. Your data is backed up daily. You can export everything you've ever entered at any time.

**"What about support?"**

Email support with same-day response. Extensive documentation. Live onboarding call if you want it.

## Pricing Page Design Notes

### Visual Hierarchy Recommendations

1. **Hero:** Large, bold headline. Calculator prominent. No clutter.
2. **Value proof:** Side-by-side comparisons (before/after tables work well)
3. **Module list:** Icon grid or card layout. Scannable, not overwhelming.
4. **ROI section:** Big numbers. Let the math speak.
5. **CTA:** Repeated at multiple scroll points. Same primary action throughout.

### Copy Principles Applied

- **Lead with outcome, not features** — "10:1 return" before module list
- **Anchor to familiar cost** — $34.95 = 1 hour of technician time
- **Quantify everything** — 87-93%, $22K-45K, 22+ hours/week
- **One clear pricing model** — Formula visible immediately, no tiers to parse
- **Risk reversal** — Free trial, no contract, export anytime
- **Identity-based closing** — "Built by Level 3 technician" speaks to tech-origin owners

### A/B Test Recommendations

1. **Headline test:** "Pay for 1 Hour. Get 10 Back." vs. "One Hour. One Tech. One Month."
2. **ROI emphasis:** Full calculator vs. simple "platform pays for itself in 60 days"
3. **Social proof placement:** Above pricing vs. after feature list
4. **CTA copy:** "Start Free Trial" vs. "See It In Action"
