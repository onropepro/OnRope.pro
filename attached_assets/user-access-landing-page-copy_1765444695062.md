### Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** Rope access company owners (5-50 technicians), operations managers, building managers
**Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware (knows current systems expose sensitive data, no alternative found)
**Core Insight:** Every rope access owner has experienced that stomach-drop moment when they realize their supervisor just saw everyone's pay rates
**Emotional Territory:** Relief, control, protection
**Psychological Frameworks:** Loss aversion (protect what's yours), autonomy (delegate without losing control), identity (professional operation vs. chaos)

## Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Your supervisor doesn't need to see what everyone makes.**

### Alternative Headlines

1. Finally delegate without exposing your payroll.
2. Give your team system access. Keep your financials private.
3. Stop choosing between operational efficiency and payroll confidentiality.
4. "All or nothing" access is costing you control.
5. Built for the moment you realize your new hire can see everyone's rates.

### Subheadline

Grant project creation, employee scheduling, and safety compliance access to the people who need it. Keep hourly rates, labor costs, and profit margins visible only to you.

## Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

The Access Problem Nobody Talks About

### Body Copy

Construction software wasn't built for your business.

The moment you add your supervisor to the system, they see everything. Pay rates. Profit margins. Which jobs lose money. Which technicians cost you the most.

It's not that you don't trust them. It's that some information belongs at the owner level. Period.

Most systems force a choice: handle everything yourself (and become the bottleneck), or give access and hope nobody looks where they shouldn't.

OnRopePro separates what people can do from what they can see.

## Features Section

### Section Header

Control What Each Person Can Access

### Feature 1: Granular Permission Controls

**Your bookkeeper sees aggregate labor costs. Not individual rates.**

Customize exactly what each employee can view and edit. Your supervisor creates projects and assigns crews without seeing what anyone earns. Your office admin processes invoices without seeing your profit margins.

### Feature 2: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**Your company's data exists in a completely separate partition.**

Every query, every report, every dashboard filters automatically to your company. A security issue with another account cannot expose your information. Bank-level protection without an IT department.

### Feature 3: IRATA/SPRAT Level Tracking

**Answer client questions in seconds, not minutes.**

Each employee profile includes certification level. When a client asks which Level 2 or 3 techs are available next week, you know instantly. No spreadsheets. No digging through files. No outdated information.

### Feature 4: Building-Level Accounts

**New building manager? Change one login, not twelve vendor accounts.**

Property managers turnover every 6-12 months. Building accounts persist through staff changes. No vendor coordination when managers change. No access gaps. No stale credentials.

### Feature 5: Resident Portal Access

**Unit 1847 checks their own progress instead of calling the property manager.**

Building occupants see project updates, schedules, and photos for their own building. Real-time visibility reduces status calls by 60-70%. Residents know when work reaches their elevation without calling anyone.

### Feature 6: Audit Trail

**Every permission change logged. Every access attempt recorded.**

When questions arise, answers exist. See who changed what, when, and from where. Retention policies ensure compliance while removing sensitive data appropriately.

## Problems Solved Section

### Section Header

We Built This for Situations Like Yours

### For Company Owners

**"My supervisor accidentally saw everyone's pay rates."**

You need your ops manager to create projects and check budgets. The moment you grant access, they see what every technician earns. Now your Level 1 knows your Level 3 lead makes $18 more per hour.

OnRopePro separates operational access from financial visibility. Grant project creation, scheduling, and client communication without exposing rate information.

**"A technician changed his own hourly rate from $32 to $42."**

He also adjusted last week's drop counts. You discovered it during payroll when the numbers didn't add up. Traditional systems let anyone modify data they can see.

Permission controls restrict editing based on assigned capabilities. Technicians log work for assigned projects. Only designated managers modify rates, historical records, and financial data.

**"I don't know if I have seats available to hire someone."**

Peak season hit. You needed three temporary techs immediately. But you couldn't remember your plan's limit, and you didn't know how many seats you were using.

Your dashboard shows "Using 7 of 8 seats" with visual indicators. Make hiring decisions confidently. Avoid surprise overage charges.

### For Operations Managers

**"I want my field supervisors to create projects when clients call."**

Your most trusted supervisor handles the entire North Shore territory. When clients call, he has to reach you to create the project. You're in meetings. Clients wait hours for setup that takes two minutes.

Grant project creation and employee assignment without financial access. Supervisors handle day-to-day operations independently. You focus on strategic work.

### For Building Managers

**"I'm the middleman for every issue between residents and vendors."**

Mrs. Chen emails you photos of streaky windows. You forward to the rope access company. Three days pass with no response. Meanwhile, Mrs. Chen files council complaints about management responsiveness.

Centralized feedback with building-level visibility. Residents submit directly. You see all feedback in real-time without being in the communication chain. Average resolution drops from 3-5 days to 24 hours.

**"Building manager turnover every 6-12 months creates access chaos."**

Sarah managed Tower One for 8 months. Mike takes over. You email 12 vendors requesting account changes. Three weeks later, Sarah still has access and Mike can't log in.

Building accounts transfer with the role, not the person. Access changes happen in minutes, not weeks.

### For Residents

**"I see maintenance equipment on the roof. Nobody tells me what's happening."**

Technicians are on the west side Monday. Are they coming to your side? You need to move balcony plants before cleaning. You call the building manager. They don't know. They contact the vendor.

The resident portal shows which elevations are complete. The schedule shows east elevation starts Wednesday. You move your plants Tuesday night. No calls necessary.

## Technical Credibility Section

### Section Header

Enterprise Security Built for Small Operations

### Body Copy

**Session Management**
Automatic expiration after 30 days of inactivity. Secure logout clears all session data. Users remain logged in across browser sessions until explicit logout or expiration.

**Password Security**
Industry-standard bcrypt hashing with salt rounds. Passwords are never stored in plain text. Not even you can retrieve them. Reset only.

**API Protection**
Every endpoint validates authentication, permission, and company scope. Financial data filtered unless user has financial permissions.

**Request Security**
CSRF protection via token-based validation. Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks. SQL injection blocked through parameterized statements. All traffic encrypted via TLS/SSL.

## Module Integration Section

### Section Header

Permissions Flow Through Everything

### Body Copy

User access controls aren't a feature. They're the foundation.

When you grant someone project creation rights, they can create projects. When you withhold financial visibility, dashboards, reports, and data exports all respect that decision.

**Employee Directory**: Only owners create employees and assign roles. Prevents unauthorized hiring.

**Payroll & Time Tracking**: Supervisors see hours worked. Technicians see only their own time. Owners see full payroll cost visibility. 100% confidentiality maintained.

**Safety & Compliance**: Technicians submit safety documents. Safety officers review. Owners see audit trails. Building managers see approval status. Clear responsibility chain.

**Scheduling & Projects**: Owners create and assign. Supervisors manage their projects. Technicians see their scheduled work. Residents see their building's progress. Data scope limits automatically.

**Analytics & Reporting**: Owners see full financial and productivity analytics. Building managers see their building's data. Technicians see personal metrics. Reporting respects permission boundaries completely.

## Format-Specific Notes

**Character Counts (for ad platforms):**
- Primary headline: 54 characters
- Subheadline: 184 characters (may need trimming for some platforms)

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Hero: Split screen showing "before" (generic software with all data visible) and "after" (filtered view by role)
- Features: Permission matrix diagram showing who sees what
- Problems: Testimonial-style cards with specific scenarios
- Technical: Security badges, encryption icons, audit trail visualization

**Platform Considerations:**
- LinkedIn: Emphasize business outcomes and professional credibility
- Google Ads: Focus on search intent around "construction software permissions" or "employee access control"
- Direct mail/email: Lead with specific problem scenarios that trigger recognition
