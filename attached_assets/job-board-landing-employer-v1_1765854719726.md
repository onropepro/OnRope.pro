# Job Board Ecosystem Landing Page: Employer Edition

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025  
**Primary Audience:** Company Owners / Operations Managers  
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware (know Indeed sucks, don't know alternatives exist)

**Core Insight:** Employers aren't frustrated by "recruitment" in the abstract. They're frustrated by paying $22 per useless application from people who've never touched a rope system. They want a filter that actually filters.

**Psychological Frameworks:**
- Loss Aversion (stop bleeding money on Indeed fees)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one place, only relevant people)
- Reciprocity (free access creates loyalty)
- Social Proof (verified operators, verified techs)

**Emotional Territory:** Relief (finally, no more noise)

---

## Hero Section

**Primary Headline:**

> Stop Paying $22 Per Application From People Who've Never Touched a Rope.

**Alternative Headlines:**

1. "50 Resumes. 2 Actual Rope Techs. Sound Familiar?"
2. "The Job Board Where 100% of Applicants Are Rope Access Professionals"
3. "Indeed Charges You Per Application. We Charge You Per Mouth to Feed."

**Subheadline:**

OnRopePro's Job Board is a closed ecosystem. Every employer verified. Every technician relevant. Post unlimited jobs. Zero per-application fees.

**CTA:** Start Posting Jobs Free (90-Day Trial)

---

## Problem Statement Section

**Section Header:** The Indeed Tax

**Body Copy:**

You post on Indeed. LinkedIn. Craigslist. Facebook. You get 50 applications. You open each one, hoping for a Level 2 with caulking experience.

What you find: shop laborers, pipe fitters, offshore oil rig candidates, and 23 people who "have always been interested in learning." Two hours of filtering. Two actual rope techs.

Then Indeed hits you with the bill. $22 per application if you don't respond within 48 hours. A single posting costs you $300 before you've even scheduled an interview. Someone on your team has to log in every day just to click "decline" on resumes from car mechanics.

OnRopePro's Job Board works differently.

Every company here does rope access building maintenance. Every technician here is in the industry. When you post a job, 100% of applicants are relevant. No noise. No filtering. No $22 surprise fees.

## What This Module Does

**Section Header:** Your Closed Garden Ecosystem  
**Subheadline:** Where every applicant is a rope tech and every employer is verified

**Intro Copy:**

The Job Board connects you with qualified rope access technicians across the platform. Post jobs, browse talent, and send direct offers to candidates who match your requirements.

---

**Card 1: Talent Browser**

Search the technician pool before you even post a job. Filter by location, certification level, experience, and expected pay rate. See who's available, what they're looking for, and whether your budget matches their expectations before you spend time interviewing.

**What you can filter by:**

- Location (city, region)
- IRATA/SPRAT certification level
- Years of experience
- Expected pay rate
- Safety rating score
- Specialties (caulking, window washing, pressure washing, etc.)

---

**Card 2: Unlimited Job Postings**

Post as many jobs as your operation requires. Full-time, part-time, contract, seasonal. Six job types supported: window washing, caulking, pressure washing, gutter cleaning, painting and coating, visual inspection. No per-post fees. No per-application charges. No surprise invoices.

**What you control:**

- Job type and service scope
- Location and site details
- Required certifications
- Pay range (optional but recommended)
- Start date and duration

---

**Card 3: Direct Job Offers**

Found a perfect candidate in the Talent Browser? Send them an offer directly. Link it to one of your active job postings. They get notified in their portal. Accept or decline with one tap. No email chains. No phone tag.

**How it works:**

- Select candidate from search results
- Choose which job posting to link
- Technician receives in-portal notification
- Response comes back to your dashboard

---

## Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Zero filtering. Every applicant is a rope tech.** You post a job. You receive applications from people who actually work in rope access building maintenance. Not pipe fitters. Not offshore workers. Not "interested in learning." Your applicant-to-interview ratio improves immediately.

**Know salary expectations before you reach out.** Technicians set their expected pay rate in their profile. When you browse talent, you see their number before sending an offer. If someone won't work under $60/hour and your budget is $45, you know before wasting an hour on an interview.

**Included in your subscription.** Post unlimited jobs. Receive unlimited applications. Indeed charges $22 per application if you don't respond in 48 hours. OnRopePro charges $0. Your job board access is part of what you already pay for.

---

### For Operations Managers

**Browse talent before you post.** Need a Level 2 with caulking experience in the Lower Mainland? Search the Talent Browser. See who's available, check their safety ratings, review their expected rates. Find candidates first, then create the job posting to match what's available.

**Direct offers streamline hiring.** Find a strong candidate? Send them an offer linked to your job posting. No more "I'll send you an email with the details." The offer, the job specs, and the accept/decline button are all in one place.

---

### For Building Managers

**Verify contractor hiring practices.** When your rope access contractor uses OnRopePro, their technicians have documented IRATA/SPRAT certifications and visible safety ratings. You're not just trusting their word. You're seeing verified credentials tied to real work history.

---

### For Property Managers

**Confidence in contractor quality.** The contractors bidding on your portfolio use a system where every technician is verified. When they tell you "our team is certified and safety-focused," you can see the data backing that claim.

---

### For Technicians

**Get found by employers who matter.** When you turn on profile visibility, only verified rope access companies can see you. No random recruiters. No spam. Companies actively hiring in your specialty can search for you directly and send offers to your portal.

---

## Key Features

**Intro Copy:**

The Job Board ecosystem combines posting, searching, and hiring into one integrated system.

---

**Feature 1: Verified Employer Ecosystem**

Only rope access building maintenance companies post here. Every employer is verified when they create an account. No bakeries, no car washes, no unrelated industries. When you browse competitors' postings, you're seeing your actual market.

---

**Feature 2: One-Click Applications Inbound**

When technicians apply, their profile data, resume, and certifications auto-attach. You see everything you need to evaluate them in one view. No "please resend your resume" emails. No "can you confirm your IRATA number" phone calls.

---

**Feature 3: Expected Pay Rate Visibility**

See what candidates want before you engage. If your budget is $45/hour and they want $60, you know immediately. Stop wasting interview time on compensation mismatches.

---

**Feature 4: Safety Rating Integration**

Every technician has an Individual Safety Rating (0-100) built from daily harness inspections, toolbox talk participation, and safety quiz completions. See it in their profile. Factor it into your hiring decisions.

---

**Feature 5: Application Status Dashboard**

Track every applicant across every posting. See who's under review, who you've contacted, who's been offered, who's accepted. No spreadsheets. No losing candidates between the cracks.

---

**Feature 6: Instant Onboarding Connection**

When a technician accepts your offer, their profile data flows into your employee management system. IRATA number, certifications, banking details (if shared), emergency contacts. Day-one ready without the paperwork marathon.

---

## Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"I post on Indeed and get 50 applicants. Only 2 are actual rope techs."**

You post everywhere: Indeed, LinkedIn, Craigslist, Facebook. Applications flood in from people who've never touched a rope system. Shop laborers, general construction workers, offshore candidates. Two hours filtering to find two relevant resumes.

OnRopePro's Job Board is a closed ecosystem. Every technician on the platform is in rope access building maintenance. When you post a job, 100% of applicants are relevant. No filtering required.

---

**"Indeed charges me $22 per application if I don't respond in 48 hours."**

Someone has to log in daily, open every application, decline or respond. Miss a few days? That's $22 times every unopened application. A single job posting can cost $300 in "engagement fees" before you've hired anyone.

OnRopePro includes unlimited postings and applications in your subscription. No per-application fees. No surprise charges. No daily login obligation just to avoid billing.

---

**"I spent an hour interviewing someone who wants $20/hour more than my budget."**

The interview went well. References checked out. You're ready to make an offer. Then you ask about compensation. They want $60/hour. Your budget is $45. An hour wasted for both parties.

Technicians set expected pay rate in their profile. You see it in the Talent Browser before reaching out. Compensation mismatches get filtered before the interview, not during.

---

### For Operations Managers

**"I don't know if we have capacity to take this new contract."**

A client calls with urgent work. You think Tommy finishes Tower A on Friday, but you're not certain. Is Sarah on vacation? You either decline the work (lost revenue) or commit and hope (risk of overcommitting).

The Job Board connects to your scheduling and employee management systems. When you post a job and receive applications, you can cross-reference against crew availability. Know if you have capacity before you commit.

---

### For Building Managers

**"How do I know this contractor hires qualified workers?"**

You hire a rope access company but have no visibility into who they're actually sending to your building. Are these people certified? Do they have safety records? You're trusting the contractor's word.

When contractors use OnRopePro, their technicians have verified IRATA/SPRAT certifications and visible safety ratings. You can ask for documentation. The data exists in their system.

---

**Section Header:** Your Hiring Time Goes to Zero. Your Talent Pool Goes to Everyone.

**Body Copy:**

Right now, hiring eats your week. You post on Indeed. You wait for applications. You filter through irrelevant resumes. You interview people who want double your budget. You pay $22 per application from pipe fitters.

When they accept, their data flows into your employee management. No re-entering IRATA numbers. No requesting void cheques. No "can you send me your emergency contact again." Day-one ready.

That's what hiring looks like when every applicant is a rope tech and every employer is verified.

## FAQs

**"Is there a cost per application like Indeed?"**

No. OnRopePro includes unlimited job postings and applications in your subscription. Post as many jobs as you want. Receive as many applications as you want. No per-application fees.

---

**"Will you scrape jobs from Indeed or other sites?"**

No. The Job Board grows organically. Every listing comes from a verified rope access building maintenance company within the ecosystem. No imported jobs from other platforms.

---

**"Can I see who applied to my jobs?"**

Yes. You see all applications with profile details, resume, certifications, and safety ratings for technicians who have enabled profile visibility.

---

**"Can I search for candidates before posting a job?"**

Yes. The Talent Browser lets you search the entire technician pool. Filter by location, certifications, experience, and expected pay rate. Find candidates first, then create job postings to match.

---

**"How do I send a job offer to a specific technician?"**

From the Talent Browser, find the technician you want to hire. Click "Send Job Offer" and select which of your active job postings to link. The technician receives a notification in their portal.

---

**"What happens when they accept?"**

If they're already on the platform, onboarding is nearly instant. Their profile data flows into your employee management system. You enter their pay rate and set permissions. They're ready to work on day one.

---

**"What if a technician's profile is set to private?"**

Technicians control their visibility. If they've toggled it off, they won't appear in your Talent Browser searches. They can still apply to your job postings and share their information through that process.

---

**"How is the safety rating calculated?"**

The Individual Safety Rating (0-100) builds from daily harness inspections, toolbox talk participation, safety quiz completions, and near-miss reporting. It's earned through real activity on the platform, not self-reported.
