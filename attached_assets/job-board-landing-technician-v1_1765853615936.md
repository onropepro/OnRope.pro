# Job Board Ecosystem Landing Page: Technician Edition

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025  
**Primary Audience:** Rope Access Technicians (employed and job-seeking)  
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-Aware (know Indeed sucks for rope access jobs, don't know an alternative exists)

**Core Insight:** Technicians aren't frustrated by "job searching" in the abstract. They're frustrated by searching "rope access Vancouver" on Indeed and getting offshore oil rig jobs, pipe fitter postings, and general construction gigs. They want one place where every job is rope access building maintenance.

**Psychological Frameworks:**
- Autonomy (control over visibility and who sees your profile)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (every job is relevant, no filtering)
- Loss Aversion (don't miss opportunities while your profile sits invisible)
- Identity Affirmation (you're a rope tech, this is built for rope techs)

**Emotional Territory:** Belonging (finally, a place that speaks our language)

## Problem Statement Section

**Section Header:** Indeed Thinks You Want to Be a Pipe Fitter

**Body Copy:**

You search "rope access" on Indeed. What do you get?

Offshore oil platforms in the Maritimes. Industrial access jobs at Alberta refineries. Pipe fitter positions that mention "rope" once in the safety section. General construction gigs that require "working at heights."

You scroll for 20 minutes to find 3 jobs that might actually be rope access building maintenance. Maybe.

Then you apply. Upload your resume. Fill out the same form for the 50th time. Manually type your IRATA number because there's no field for it. Wonder if the company even checked your certification.

OnRopePro's Job Board works differently.

Every job posted here is rope access building maintenance. Window washing. Caulking. Pressure washing. Gutter cleaning. Painting and coating. Visual inspection. No offshore. No oil rigs. No pipe fitting.

Every company posting is verified. Real rope access operators who do real building maintenance. When you apply, your certifications, experience, and safety rating go with your application automatically.

## Stakeholder Benefits

### For Technicians

**Every job is rope access building maintenance.** No more scrolling past offshore rigs, pipe fitting positions, and "working at heights" construction gigs. Every posting here is from a verified rope access company doing building maintenance. Window washing, caulking, pressure washing, gutter cleaning, painting, visual inspection. That's it.

**Apply once, your credentials follow everywhere.** Upload your resume, enter your IRATA number, set your expected pay rate. Every application you send includes this information automatically. No more typing the same details into 50 different forms.

**You control who sees you.** Toggle profile visibility on when you're actively looking. Toggle it off when you're not. If you're employed but casually browsing, keep it off. Employers can't find you unless you want them to.

**Know what they're paying before you apply.** Many employers list pay ranges on job postings. For those who don't, you can set your expected rate and let them decide if it matches their budget before they reach out.

---

### For Employers

**Find technicians who match your requirements.** Search the Talent Browser by certification level, location, experience, and expected pay rate. See safety ratings before reaching out. Send offers directly to candidates who fit.

## Problems Solved

### For Technicians

**"I search 'rope access' on Indeed and get pipe fitter and offshore oil jobs."**

You want rope access building maintenance work. You search Indeed. Results: industrial access at refineries, offshore platforms, general construction that mentions "heights." You scroll for 30 minutes to find 2-3 maybe-relevant postings.

OnRopePro's Job Board is exclusively for rope access building maintenance. Every job is window washing, caulking, pressure washing, gutter cleaning, painting, or visual inspection on buildings. No offshore. No pipe fitting. No oil rigs. No scrolling through irrelevant listings.

---

**"I apply to jobs and manually enter my IRATA number every single time."**

Indeed doesn't have a field for IRATA certification. Neither does LinkedIn. You upload your resume, then manually type your cert number into a notes field. Sometimes you forget. Sometimes they don't even read it.

On OnRopePro, your IRATA/SPRAT certification is part of your profile. It attaches to every application automatically. Employers see your cert level, your number, your expiration date. No manual entry. No forgotten information.

---

**"I don't want my current employer to know I'm looking for work."**

You're employed. It's fine. But you wouldn't mind seeing what else is out there. Problem: if you make yourself visible on a job board, your boss might find out. Awkward conversation ahead.

Profile visibility is opt-in. Keep it toggled off: you can browse jobs, apply to postings, and stay invisible to the Talent Browser. Your current employer can't stumble across your profile. Toggle it on only when you're ready to be found.

---

**"I spent an hour interviewing for a job that pays $15/hour less than I need."**

The listing didn't show pay. You applied, interviewed, got along great with the owner. Then they offered $45/hour. You need $60 to make the numbers work. An hour of your time wasted. An hour of their time wasted.

Set your expected pay rate in your profile. Employers see it in the Talent Browser. If they can't meet your number, they won't reach out. Compensation mismatches get filtered before the interview, not during.

---

### For Currently Employed Technicians

**"I want to know what's out there without broadcasting that I'm looking."**

You're not unhappy at your current job. But opportunities come and go. You'd like to see what companies are hiring without announcing to the industry that you're on the market.

Keep profile visibility off. Browse job postings anonymously. Apply selectively to positions that genuinely interest you. No one knows you're looking unless you tell them.

---

**"I have no way to build a reputation that follows me between employers."**

You've worked safely for five years. Never had an incident. Your current employer knows it. But when you apply to a new company, you start from zero. No documented track record. Just your word.

Your Individual Safety Rating travels with you. Built from harness inspections, toolbox talks, near-miss reports, safety quizzes. When you apply to a new job, employers see your score. Five years of safe work becomes a competitive advantage.

---

## How Will This Module Improve Your Career?

**Section Header:** Your Skills. Your Terms. Your Next Job.

**Body Copy:**

Right now, finding a rope access job means fighting the internet. Indeed shows you offshore rigs. LinkedIn shows you general construction. You spend more time filtering irrelevant postings than actually applying.

With OnRopePro's Job Board, every job is rope access building maintenance. Period. You search "caulking + Vancouver" and you get caulking jobs in Vancouver. Not pipe fitting. Not offshore platforms. Not "working at heights."

When you find a job you want, you apply in 30 seconds. Your resume, your IRATA number, your safety rating, your expected pay rate, all attached automatically. No forms. No manual entry. No hoping they actually read your certification.

And when you're ready to be found, toggle profile visibility on. Let employers search for you. Let them send you direct offers. Let your safety rating speak for you.

That's what job searching looks like when the platform is built for rope techs.

You can still create an account, upload your certifications, and apply to jobs. Your safety rating will build once you're connected to an employer on the platform.

---

**"How does the expected pay rate work?"**

You set what you want to earn per hour. Employers see this when they browse the Talent Browser. If your rate is $55/hour and they're offering $40, they can choose not to reach out. Saves everyone time.

If the employer uses OnRopePro, onboarding is nearly instant. Your profile data flows to their system. They enter your pay rate and permissions. You're ready to work on day one without re-entering your information.
