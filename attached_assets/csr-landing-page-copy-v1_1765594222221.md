## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Know exactly how safe your company is. Prove it to anyone who asks.**

### Alternative Headlines

1. Stop guessing about safety. Start measuring it.
2. Your safety reputation, quantified.

### Subheadline

The Company Safety Rating transforms scattered paperwork and good intentions into a single, auditable number. Property managers see it when comparing vendors. Technicians see it when evaluating job offers. You see it when building a culture that protects your people and your business.

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

**The Safety Problem Nobody Talks About**

### Body Copy

Every rope access company says they're safe. Every one of them.

But when WorkSafe shows up and asks for proof, most operators scramble through filing cabinets, truck glove boxes, and text message threads looking for documentation that may or may not exist. When a property manager asks which vendor is safer, they're comparing marketing claims, not evidence. When a technician decides whether to accept a job, they're gambling their life on an employer's word.

Safety without measurement is just hope. And hope is not a strategy when someone's hanging 40 stories up.

OnRopePro's Company Safety Rating changes the conversation. Instead of "we're safe," you get a number: 87%. Instead of scattered forms, you get a single dashboard showing exactly where you stand and what needs attention. Instead of guessing, you know.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header

**What the CSR Module Does**

### Subheadline

A penalty-based compliance scoring system that measures safety posture in real time.

### Intro Copy

The CSR calculates your company's safety score based on documentation completeness, daily compliance behaviors, and employee acknowledgments.

### Card 1: Automatic Score Calculation

The system tracks every safety document, every harness inspection, every toolbox meeting. Your score updates automatically as compliance events occur across your operation. No manual entry. No spreadsheets. No remembering to update anything.

**What gets tracked:**

- Core company documents (COI, Health & Safety Manual, Company Policy)
- Project-level safety documentation (FLHA, Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, Anchor Inspection)
- Daily harness inspection completion rates
- Employee acknowledgment status on all safety documents

### Card 2: Transparent Visibility

Different stakeholders see appropriate levels of detail. Property managers see your overall score and color-coded compliance badge through their vendor dashboard. Company owners see full breakdowns by category with specific improvement recommendations. Technicians see enough to make informed decisions about employers.

**What each role sees:**

- Property Managers: Overall percentage, color badge (green/yellow/orange/red), category breakdown
- Company Owners: Full dashboard, category scores, prioritized action items, improvement tips
- Technicians: Company CSR when evaluating job offers
- Building Managers and Residents: Nothing (they handle logistics, not vendor selection)

### Card 3: Penalty-Based Accountability

The system starts you at 75% and brings you to 100% when you upload your three core documents. From there, every compliance gap triggers a proportional penalty. Miss a harness inspection? Penalty. Toolbox meeting not completed for a project? Penalty. Employee hasn't signed updated safety procedures? Penalty.

**What creates penalties:**

- Missing or expired company documentation (up to 25%)
- Incomplete project documentation (up to 25%)
- Harness inspections not completed before work sessions (up to 25%)
- Unsigned employee acknowledgments on safety documents (up to 5%)

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Replace guesswork with certainty.** You know your crews are safe. You believe in your training. But until now, you had no objective proof. The CSR gives you a single number that reflects your actual compliance posture, updated in real time as your team completes inspections and signs documents.

**Turn safety investment into competitive advantage.** When a property manager compares your 91% rating against a competitor's 47%, they're not comparing marketing materials. They're comparing documented evidence of safety culture. That difference wins contracts.

**Protect yourself from regulatory nightmares.** When WorkSafe arrives, you pull up a dashboard showing every harness inspection, every signed document, every toolbox meeting, with timestamps and signatures. What used to be a multi-day scramble becomes a five-minute conversation.

### For Technicians

**Evaluate employers before accepting jobs.** Your life is on the line every time you clip in. The CSR lets you see how seriously a potential employer takes safety before you commit. A company with a 95% rating operates differently than one sitting at 35%.

**Access safety documents anywhere.** Every policy you've signed, every procedure you've acknowledged, stays accessible in the app. Suspended 40 stories up and need to check company protocol on working alone? It's right there.

**Build your own safety reputation.** Your compliance behaviors contribute to company scores. Daily harness inspections, document sign-offs, and toolbox meeting participation create a record that follows you.

### For Building Managers

**Not applicable.** Building managers handle on-site logistics: keys, water access, parking, site coordination. They don't make vendor selection decisions and don't need visibility into contractor safety scores.

### For Property Managers

**Compare vendors on facts, not claims.** Every rope access company promises they're safe. The CSR gives you objective data to back up or contradict those promises. A color-coded badge in your vendor dashboard shows at a glance which contractors actually maintain their safety programs.

**Reduce your liability exposure.** Selecting a vendor with documented poor safety practices exposes your management company to liability. The CSR provides due diligence documentation showing you made data-driven vendor decisions.

**Justify decisions to owners and boards.** When building ownership asks why you chose one contractor over another, "they had a 94% safety rating versus 61%" is a defensible answer.

### For Residents

**Not visible.** Residents seeing vendor safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns and complaints without context. Their transparency comes through project progress tracking, not contractor compliance metrics.

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy

The CSR module integrates with every safety-related system in OnRopePro to calculate accurate, real-time compliance scores.

### Feature 1: Three-Document Baseline

Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100% baseline. These three documents form the foundation of your safety documentation, and the system tracks expiration dates and renewal status.

### Feature 2: Project Document Tracking

Each project requires four safety documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing documents trigger proportional penalties that scale with your total project volume.

### Feature 3: Harness Inspection Integration

Daily harness inspections before work sessions contribute directly to your CSR. The system calculates completion rates across all technicians and all work sessions, so consistent compliance over thousands of sessions builds a strong score that individual misses barely dent.

### Feature 4: Employee Document Acknowledgments

When you add Safe Work Procedures or Safe Work Practices to your document library, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign. This ensures every team member has actually read your safety policies, not just that the documents exist somewhere.

### Feature 5: Color-Coded Compliance Badge

Your CSR displays as a visual badge: green (90-100%), yellow (70-89%), orange (50-69%), or red (below 50%). Property managers see this badge instantly in their vendor dashboard without needing to interpret raw numbers.

### Feature 6: Exportable Compliance Reports

Generate PDF reports showing all employee signatures with timestamps for every safety document. When WorkSafe asks "how do you know your employees saw this policy?", you have immediate, exportable proof.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"I know I should be safer, but I don't have time to create all the paperwork."**

Creating comprehensive safety documentation from scratch takes days of administrative work. Hiring someone to build PDF templates, researching regulatory requirements, getting legal sign-off on policy language. Most small operators never get around to it because they're too busy actually running jobs.

OnRopePro provides pre-made templates for Safe Work Procedures and Safe Work Practices specific to rope access operations. Add a document in two minutes, send a notification to all employees, each tech signs in under a minute. What would take days becomes a quick task with full documentation trail.

**"When WorkSafe shows up, I can't prove my employees know the procedures."**

You've told your crew a hundred times about the rules. They know. You know they know. But when the regulator asks for documentation proving employees reviewed and understood specific procedures, paper trails are either incomplete, scattered across filing cabinets, or simply missing.

Export a PDF report showing all employee signatures with timestamps for every safety document. When WorkSafe asks "how do you know your employee saw it?", hand them the report. Transform a multi-day compliance scramble into instant verification.

**"I don't know how safe my company actually is."**

Without measurable metrics, safety becomes an emotional assessment. You think you're safe because nothing bad has happened yet. That's survivorship bias, not evidence.

CSR provides a single number showing your safety posture instantly. Score drops from 87% to 72%? You know immediately something needs attention, and the dashboard shows exactly what. Move from "I think we're safe" to "I know we're 87% compliant, and here's exactly what needs improvement."

**"Property managers are choosing competitors over me."**

You invest in safety, train your people properly, maintain your equipment. But when bidding against competitors, you have no way to demonstrate that investment. Everyone claims to be safe. Claims are cheap.

Your 91% CSR rating versus a competitor's 47% becomes a decisive factor in vendor selection. Convert your actual safety investment into a competitive advantage that wins contracts.

### For Technicians

**"I don't know if this company is actually safe to work for."**

Your life depends on your employer's commitment to safety. Not their marketing. Not their promises during the interview. Their actual day-to-day practices around equipment inspection, documentation, and compliance.

CSR is visible when you evaluate job offers. Would you rather work for a company with a 40% rating or a 95% rating? Now you can make informed decisions about putting your life on the line.

**"I need access to safety documents on the job site."**

Company policies and procedures live in an office filing cabinet while you're suspended from a building. When you need to check protocol for an unusual situation, you're out of luck.

All signed safety documents are accessible in the app. Need to check company policy on working alone, confined space entry, or emergency procedures? It's right there, any time you need it.

### For Property Managers

**"I can't objectively compare vendor safety."**

Every rope access contractor promises excellent safety practices. You have no way to verify those claims or compare them objectively. Current due diligence consists of checking if they have insurance and maybe calling a reference.

View each vendor's CSR through your "My Vendors" dashboard. Color-coded badges provide instant assessment. Green means they're running a tight operation. Red means they need work. Make data-driven vendor decisions based on documented compliance, not marketing materials.

## 7. Measurable Results

### Safety Visibility

Transform "I think we're safe" into "I know we're 87% compliant." The CSR provides real-time, objective measurement of your safety posture across documentation, daily behaviors, and employee acknowledgments. Score changes alert you to compliance gaps before they become regulatory problems.

### Documentation Time

What previously took days of administrative work (researching templates, creating PDFs, distributing for signatures, tracking completion) now takes minutes. Pre-built templates for Safe Work Procedures and Practices specific to rope access operations. Add a document, notify employees, track sign-offs automatically.

### Regulatory Readiness

WorkSafe inspections typically require producing documentation across harness inspections, safety meetings, employee training acknowledgments, and company policies. The CSR dashboard consolidates everything into exportable reports with timestamps and signatures, transforming compliance audits from multi-day scrambles into simple PDF exports.

### Competitive Differentiation

Property managers selecting between vendors with visible CSR ratings make objectively different decisions than those comparing marketing claims. Companies investing in safety documentation can now demonstrate that investment in a format property managers see during vendor evaluation.

## 8. Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy

The CSR pulls compliance data from across your OnRopePro system, integrating safety behaviors into a unified score.

### Safety & Compliance

Core source of documentation status. The CSR reads which company documents are uploaded, current, and signed by employees. Safe Work Procedures and Safe Work Practices template completions feed directly into score calculations.

### Inventory & Inspections

Daily harness inspection completion rates from the equipment management system contribute to CSR. Inspection records with pass/fail status, inspector identification, and timestamps all factor into the harness inspection penalty category.

### Toolbox Meetings

Project-level toolbox meeting completion feeds the project documents penalty. The system tracks which projects have associated safety meetings and which are missing required documentation.

### Project Management

Project creation triggers documentation requirements (Anchor Inspection, Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, FLHA). The CSR tracks completion status across all active and historical projects to calculate project document compliance rates.

### Employee Management

Employee acknowledgment status on safety documents comes from the employee record system. When new employees join or documents are updated, the CSR reflects pending signatures that need completion.

### Building Manager Portal

Property managers accessing the vendor dashboard see CSR badges pulled from this module. The integration provides appropriate visibility (overall score and badge) without exposing detailed operational data.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header

**Stop Hoping You're Safe. Start Knowing.**

### Body Copy

Right now, you're spending hours every month on safety documentation that may or may not be organized, may or may not be complete, and may or may not survive a WorkSafe inspection. Your crew knows the rules because you've told them, but you can't prove they've read and acknowledged specific policies. Property managers choose between you and competitors based on who has the better sales pitch, not who actually runs safer operations.

The CSR changes the foundation of how safety works in your business.

Every harness inspection, every signed document, every toolbox meeting becomes part of a living compliance score that updates automatically. When a tech forgets to do their morning inspection, you see your score dip and address it immediately instead of discovering the gap during an audit six months later. When you add new safety procedures, the system tracks exactly who has and hasn't reviewed them, so you can follow up with specific people instead of broadcasting reminders to everyone.

Property managers comparing vendors see your 92% rating next to a competitor's 58%. That's not marketing. That's documented evidence of how you actually run your operation.

When WorkSafe arrives, you pull up a dashboard instead of rummaging through filing cabinets. Everything is timestamped, signed, and exportable to PDF. The regulator leaves satisfied in minutes instead of camping out for days.

Your technicians can evaluate employers before accepting jobs. Your competitors can't hide behind promises anymore. Your safety investment finally translates into business results.

## 10. FAQs

**How is the starting score calculated?**

New companies start at 75%. Upload your Certificate of Insurance, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy to reach 100%. From there, penalties are applied based on ongoing compliance gaps.

**What if I add Safe Work Procedures and my score drops?**

This is intentional. When you add new safety documents, your score temporarily decreases until employees review and sign them. This ensures documents aren't just uploaded and forgotten. Once all employees acknowledge the new procedures, your score returns to full compliance.

**How do harness inspection penalties work?**

The penalty is calculated as a percentage of missed inspections against total work sessions. If you have 1,000 work sessions and miss 10 inspections, that's a 1% penalty. If you're just starting and have 10 sessions with 5 missed inspections, that's a 50% penalty in this category. Consistent compliance over time builds a resilient score.

**Can technicians see my CSR before accepting job offers?**

Yes. Technicians evaluating potential employers can see company CSR ratings. This allows them to make informed decisions about safety before committing to a position.

**What do property managers see?**

Property managers see your overall CSR percentage and a color-coded badge (green, yellow, orange, or red) through their vendor dashboard. They can also see category breakdowns but not your internal operational details.

**Who cannot see my CSR?**

Building managers and residents. Building managers handle on-site logistics (keys, water, parking) and don't make vendor selection decisions. Residents seeing safety scores would generate unnecessary concerns without appropriate context.

**What documents are required for each project?**

Four documents: Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing), Rope Access Plan, Toolbox Meeting, and FLHA. Missing any of these for a project contributes to your project documents penalty.

**Can my score ever reach 100% again after adding employees or documents?**

Yes. 100% is achievable when all company documents are current, all projects have complete documentation, all work sessions have associated harness inspections, and all employees have signed all required documents. The system is designed so perfect scores are difficult to maintain long-term, reflecting that nobody is 100% safe forever.

**How quickly does the score update?**

Real-time. When a technician completes a harness inspection, when an employee signs a document, when a toolbox meeting is logged, the score recalculates immediately.

**What if a new employee joins and hasn't signed anything yet?**

Your score will decrease proportionally until they complete onboarding documentation. This incentivizes prompt completion of new employee safety training and document acknowledgments.

**Can I export CSR data for insurance or regulatory purposes?**

Yes. Generate PDF reports showing employee signatures with timestamps for all safety documents, harness inspection completion records, and toolbox meeting logs. These exports satisfy insurance auditors, WorkSafe inspectors, and IRATA/SPRAT compliance requirements.

**Is the CSR visible to competitors?**

No. Only your own company owners, your technicians (when evaluating job offers), and property managers (when viewing their vendor list) can see your score. Competitors cannot access your CSR.

## Future Enhancements (Validated for Development)

**CSR Impact Logging:** Track exactly where and when your company gained or lost rating points, with specific actions tied to score changes. See "Lost 2% on December 10 because 3 harness inspections were missed at Project #47."

**Training Area:** Watch safety videos, complete quizzes, and listen to podcasts to actively improve your CSR through demonstrated learning. Companies with consistently low scores can take specific actions to rebuild compliance.

## Strategic Notes for Development

**Key Insight from Tommy (Line 275):** "I don't want anybody to have 100 because nobody is 100% safe. That would just be a lie." The system is intentionally designed so perfect scores are extremely difficult to maintain, reflecting operational reality.

**Industry Pain Point (Lines 169-170):** "Once WorkSafe shows up and finds one thing, they'll keep digging. They look at your gear, your ropes, inspect your ladders. They don't stop until they're satisfied. And they're never satisfied." The CSR addresses this by creating audit-ready documentation before inspectors arrive.

**Nucleus Module Status (Line 416):** Tommy confirmed CSR is "one of the nucleus modules" that runs through the entire platform. It's fundamental to OnRopePro's value proposition, not a standalone feature.

**Property Manager Visibility Design (Lines 215-221):** Building managers deliberately cannot see CSR because "they handle logistics, not vendor selection." This is intentional access control, not a missing feature.
