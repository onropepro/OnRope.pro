## 🎯 The Golden Rule

> **CSR is not just a number for property managers. It is an empirical way to build safety into your company culture.**

### The CSR Formula

```
CSR Score = 100% - (Documentation Penalty + Project Docs Penalty + Harness Penalty + Document Review Penalty)
```

**Starting Point:** 75% (reaches 100% when COI, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy uploaded)

**Why This Matters:** The CSR transforms safety from an unmeasured honor system into accountable, visible metrics. It tells property managers you're a safe company, but more importantly, it tells you as a company owner how safe your business actually is. When WorkSafe shows up, you have proof. When technicians evaluate job offers, they can see your commitment. When property managers compare vendors, data speaks louder than sales pitches.

**Validated Quote (Lines 176-179):**
> "This is massive. That tells, yes, it tells the property manager that you're a safe company, but it tells you as a company owner how safe you are. How safe is your business? How safe are your employees' knowledge?"

## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **Important: Safety Compliance**
>
> The Company Safety Rating (CSR) helps document and track safety compliance, but **OnRopePro is not a substitute for professional safety advice.** You remain fully responsible for workplace safety and regulatory compliance including:
>
> - OSHA/WorkSafeBC regulations
> - IRATA/SPRAT certification requirements
> - Equipment inspection standards
> - Workers' compensation insurance requirements
>
> **Requirements vary by jurisdiction.** The CSR score is a management tool, not a certification or legal determination of safety compliance. Consult with qualified safety professionals to ensure your operations meet all legal requirements.

## ✅ Problems Solved (Stakeholder-Segmented)

**The CSR module solves different problems for different stakeholders.** This section is organized by user type to help each stakeholder immediately identify the pain points most relevant to them.

---

## 👔 For Rope Access Company Owners

### Problem 1: "I know I should be safer, but I don't have time to create all the paperwork"

**The Pain:**
Company owners know they need safety documentation but lack time to find templates online, hire someone to create PDFs, gather all employees together to review and sign. The administrative burden of proper safety documentation feels impossible alongside running actual jobs. It becomes a perpetual "I'll get to it" task.

**Real Example:**
Owner wants to implement safe work procedures. Would need to: research requirements, create custom documents, print copies, schedule company meeting, collect physical signatures, file paperwork, track who signed what. This could take 2-3 full days of administrative work, time that doesn't exist during busy season.

**The Solution:**
OnRopePro provides pre-made templates for Safe Work Procedures and Safe Work Practices covering common rope access scenarios (window washing, pressure washing, facade inspection). Owner adds documents in 2 minutes, sends notification to all employees via the app, each tech reviews and signs in 1 minute per document. Digital signatures with timestamps create instant compliance trail.

**The Benefit:**
What would take 2-3 days of administrative work becomes a 2-minute task. Full documentation trail with legally binding digital signatures. No printing, no scheduling meetings, no chasing down paper forms.

**Validated Quote (Lines 162-163):**
> "All of these paperwork, safer procedures, safer practices, FLHA, toolbox meeting. They're all there and they barely have to do anything except... I'm just going to upload the pre-made one for window washing, pressure washing. It's like two minutes to add the document, and it's one minute per employee to review each document."

---

### Problem 2: "When WorkSafe shows up, I can't prove my employees know the procedures"

**The Pain:**
WorkSafe BC investigations are relentless. They show up, find one issue, then keep digging into gear, ropes, ladders, and documentation. The question always comes: "How do you know your employees have read and understand the safety procedures?" Without proof, you're scrambling to create documentation after the fact while facing compliance orders with tight deadlines.

**Real Example:**
Tommy dealt with WorkSafe BC multiple times. After one site visit where they found an issue, he had to meet them at the office two days later with Jeff, create new safe work procedure documents, fill out compliance paperwork, and meet tight deadlines. "Once they show up and they find one thing, they will keep digging and digging... They don't stop until they're satisfied. And they're never satisfied." (Lines 169-170)

**The Solution:**
Export a PDF report showing all employee signatures with timestamps for every safety document. When WorkSafe asks "How do you know your employee saw it?", you pull up the report instantly. Every signature is dated, every acknowledgment is recorded.

**The Benefit:**
Transform a multi-day compliance nightmare into "Here's my PDF, see all the signatures." Complete audit trail instantly available on any device.

**Validated Quote (Lines 157-158):**
> "The company can also export a PDF report that shows all of the employee that signed which document... See all the signatures here? Those are all employee signatures. And they've all seen it."

---

### Problem 3: "I don't actually know how safe my company is"

**The Pain:**
Safety is typically unmeasured. Owners think they're safe but have no empirical data. You tell guys to "be safe out there" but have no visibility into whether harness inspections happen daily, whether toolbox meetings occur, whether new hires have actually read the safety manual. Problems grow invisibly until an accident happens.

**Real Example:**
It's May, you just hired seven new technicians for busy season. You're slammed with jobs. Three weeks later you realize nobody told the new guys to sign the safety documents. You have no idea if they've done harness inspections. Your safety program exists on paper but you have no way to verify compliance.

**The Solution:**
CSR provides a single number that instantly shows your safety posture. Score drops? You know immediately something needs attention. Dashboard shows exactly which category is causing the drop and which employees or projects are the issue.

**The Benefit:**
Move from "I think we're safe" to "I know we're 87% compliant, and here's exactly what needs improvement." Real-time visibility into actual safety practices, not assumed ones.

**Validated Quote (Lines 164-167):**
> "Oh, shit, I'm at 50. What's going on? Oh, it's because it's May, and I just hired seven guys and I forgot to tell them to sign a document. Hey, guys, go in the app, find the document. Boom, you're back up at 92."

### Problem 4: "Property managers choose competitors and I don't know why"

**The Pain:**
When property managers compare vendors, they have no objective way to evaluate safety. Everyone claims they're safe. The company with the better pitch or lower price wins, regardless of actual safety practices. Your investment in doing things right is invisible.

**Real Example:**
You've spent years building a safety culture. Your techs do harness inspections every day. You hold toolbox meetings. Everyone has signed the safety manual. But when bidding against a competitor who cuts corners, the property manager has no way to see the difference. Price becomes the only differentiator.

**The Solution:**
CSR is visible to property managers in the "My Vendors" dashboard. Your 87% rating versus a competitor's 35% rating becomes visible, quantifiable evidence of your safety commitment.

**The Benefit:**
Convert your actual safety investment into a competitive advantage that wins contracts. Property managers can make data-driven vendor decisions instead of guessing.

**Validated Quote (Lines 163):**
> "I'm going to work real hard so the property manager picks me with like an 87 rating compared to Pacific Heights with a 22 rating. Because he doesn't give a [expletive]. I want to keep that score high."

---

### Problem 5: "If something goes wrong, I have no defense"

**The Pain:**
When an incident occurs, the question is always "Did you do everything reasonable to prevent this?" Without documentation, you have no defense. Even if you told employees the procedures verbally, you can't prove it. Liability falls entirely on you.

**Real Example:**
A technician decides to go down on one rope instead of two for a three-floor drop. He falls. WorkSafe investigates. "Did you tell your employees this isn't allowed?" You say yes. "Where's the documentation?" You have none. Now it's your word against a serious injury, with no proof your safety program existed.

**The Solution:**
Every safety document is signed digitally with timestamps. PDF export shows exactly which employee signed which procedure and when. If a tech violates a signed procedure, you have documented proof they knew the rules.

**The Benefit:**
Risk mitigation through documented compliance. "He decided on his own free will to go down one rope. He knows our procedure. He signed it. There's nothing I can do at this point." (Lines 158)

**Validated Quote (Lines 168):**
> "It's risk mitigation on the company owner's part as well. Like, I know that all of my people have read this document because they've signed it."

---

## 👷 For Rope Access Technicians

### Problem 1: "I don't know if this company is actually safe to work for"

**The Pain:**
Technicians put their lives on the line every day. When evaluating job offers or considering a new employer, there's no way to know if a company takes safety seriously until you're already on a rope 60 stories up. Some companies say "be safe" but provide no training, no documentation, no culture of safety.

**Real Example:**
You see two job postings. Both pay similar rates. Both claim to be professional operations. But one company has techs doing harness inspections daily, holds toolbox meetings, makes everyone sign safety procedures. The other company hands you gear and says "good luck." You have no way to tell which is which until you're already working there.

**The Solution:**
CSR is visible to technicians when evaluating employers. Before accepting a job, you can see the company's safety rating and what it's based on.

**The Benefit:**
Make informed career decisions based on data. Would you rather work for a company with a 40 CSR or a 95 CSR? Your life is literally on the line.

**Validated Quote (Lines 183-188):**
> "It would be like, a rope tech, would you rather go work for a company that has a 40 CSR or a 95 CSR? Because that's your life. You're putting your life on the line."

---

### Problem 2: "I can't access safety documents when I need them"

**The Pain:**
Paper-based safety documentation gets lost, sits in the office, isn't accessible on job sites. When a question comes up about proper procedure, you can't reference the documentation because it's not with you.

**Real Example:**
You're on site, about to do a confined space entry. You vaguely remember something from training about SCBA placement. The paper documentation is back at the office. You make your best guess.

**The Solution:**
All signed safety documents are accessible in the app on your phone. Need to check company policy on working alone? It's right there. Want to review the safe work procedure for the specific task? Pull it up instantly.

**The Benefit:**
Always have access to the safety information you need, exactly when you need it.

**Validated Quote (Lines 167):**
> "Everybody have access to those documents. At any point, hey, I want to know my company policy about lunch break or about working alone..."

---

### Problem 3: "My employer says safety matters but there's no accountability"

**The Pain:**
Some employers talk about safety but don't actually enforce it. They say "do your harness inspection" but never check if you did. They say "hold toolbox meetings" but don't track them. The gap between stated values and actual practice creates a culture where safety is optional.

**The Solution:**
CSR creates accountability. When harness inspections directly impact the company's score (and that score is visible to clients), suddenly safety stops being optional. The system enforces what management says they want.

**The Benefit:**
Work for companies where safety culture is backed by systems, not just words. If a company has a high CSR, you know their safety practices are actually happening, not just talked about.

---

## 🏢 For Property Managers

### Problem 1: "I can't objectively compare vendor safety"

**The Pain:**
All vendors claim they're safe. Everyone has a "safety program." Without objective measurement, you rely on gut feeling, price, or whoever gives the best pitch. If something goes wrong, you have no documentation showing you did due diligence in vendor selection.

**Real Example:**
You need to hire a rope access company for window washing on a 40-story residential tower. Three companies bid. All claim excellent safety records. You pick the cheapest one. A month later, a resident complains about unsafe practices they witnessed. You have no way to evaluate whether this is a real concern or the vendor's normal (acceptable) operations.

**The Solution:**
View each vendor's CSR through the "My Vendors" dashboard. Color-coded badges (green/yellow/orange/red) provide instant assessment. Click through for detailed breakdown of what's contributing to the score.

**The Benefit:**
Make data-driven vendor decisions. Document your due diligence in vendor selection. Protect your building and your liability with vendors who demonstrably prioritize safety.

---

### Problem 2: "I have no leverage to improve vendor safety practices"

**The Pain:**
Even if you suspect a vendor has poor safety practices, what can you do? Fire them and find another vendor who might be the same? You have no metrics to point to, no way to say "improve this specific thing."

**The Solution:**
CSR gives you specific, actionable visibility. "Your harness inspection completion rate is at 60%. We need that above 90% to continue working with you." The vendor knows exactly what to fix.

**The Benefit:**
Move from vague concerns to specific requirements. Create vendor accountability backed by data.

## 📊 CSR Visibility Matrix

### Who Can See CSR

| Stakeholder | What They See | Where They See It |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Company Owners** | Full dashboard: overall score, category breakdowns, specific metrics, improvement tips | Company Dashboard, CSR detail view |
| **Technicians** | Company CSR score when evaluating employers | Job listings, company profiles |
| **Property Managers** | Overall CSR percentage, color badge, category breakdown | "My Vendors" dashboard |

### Who Cannot See CSR

| Stakeholder | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| **Building Managers** | They handle logistics (keys, water access, site coordination), not vendor selection |
| **Residents** | Would create unnecessary concerns and complaints without context |

**Validated Quote (Lines 210-221):**
> Tommy: "I don't see that being a useful thing for [building managers]... Building managers are really like the guy who gives you the keys and fixes physical problems."

## 📈 How CSR Works

### Starting Score

CSR starts at **75%** for new companies. Upload your three core documents to reach 100%:

1. **Certificate of Insurance (COI)** - Proof of liability coverage
2. **Health & Safety Manual** - Your company's safety policies
3. **Company Policy** - General company policies and procedures

**Validated Quote (Lines 121-123):**
> "It starts at 75% and will reach 100% as soon as the company uploads their health and safety manual as well as their company policy and certificate of insurance."

### Safe Work Documents Impact

When you add Safe Work Procedures or Safe Work Practices templates, your score temporarily decreases until all employees review and sign those documents. Once all signatures are collected, your score returns to full compliance.

**Why this design:** It ensures every team member has actually read and acknowledged your safety policies. Adding a document without ensuring it's read provides no real safety benefit.

**Validated Quote (Lines 126-129):**
> "They can go through those templates and decide which one they want to have. Once they add those as their own, then the score will go back until all employees have reviewed and signed those documents."

---

## 📋 Penalty Categories

### Documentation Penalty (Max 25%)

**What's Tracked:**
- Certificate of Insurance (COI)
- Health & Safety Manual
- Company Policy

**How It Works:**
These three documents bring your score from 75% to 100%. Missing any of them keeps you at the lower baseline.

---

### Project Documents Penalty (Max 25%)

**What's Tracked (per project):**
1. **Anchor Inspection** - Verification of anchor points before use
2. **Rope Access Plan (RAP)** - Detailed plan for rope work
3. **Toolbox Meeting** - Pre-work safety discussion
4. **Field Level Hazard Assessment (FLHA)** - Site-specific hazard identification

**Important Exception:**
Anchor inspection is waived for non-rope jobs (parkade pressure washing, ground-level work). The system recognizes when anchor inspection doesn't apply.

**Validated Quote (Lines 243-261):**
> "Anchor inspection, rope access plan, toolbox meeting and FLHA... I need to change the required anchor inspection document for jobs that are just like parkade pressure washing. You're not on rope."

---

### Harness Inspection Penalty (Max 25%)

**What's Tracked:**
- Completion rate of harness inspections across all work sessions
- Each work day should have a corresponding inspection before starting work

**How It Calculates:**

The penalty is a straight percentage of missing inspections:
- 1 miss out of 1 session = 100% penalty in this category
- 1 miss out of 100 sessions = 1% penalty
- 20 misses out of 100 sessions = 20% penalty

**Key Insight:** The math is simple division. As your company accumulates more work sessions, each individual miss has proportionally less impact. This rewards consistent, long-term safety compliance while not destroying your rating for occasional lapses.

**Validated Quote (Lines 275):**
> "Once you have like a thousand sessions, if you're missing one, it won't impact you all that much... I don't want anybody to have 100 because nobody is a hundred percent safe."

---

### Document Review Penalty (Max 5%)

**What's Tracked:**
Unsigned employee acknowledgments for:
- Health & Safety Manual
- Company Policy
- Safe Work Procedures
- Safe Work Practices

**How It Works:**
When employees haven't signed required documents, this category shows the gap. The penalty is proportional to how many employees are missing signatures.

---

## 🎨 Color-Coded Badge System

Your CSR displays as a color-coded badge providing instant visual assessment:

| Score Range | Color | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100% | 🟢 Green | Excellent | Strong safety culture, highly compliant |
| 70-89% | 🟡 Yellow | Good | Solid foundation, minor gaps to address |
| 50-69% | 🟠 Orange | Warning | Significant gaps requiring attention |
| Below 50% | 🔴 Red | Critical | Serious compliance issues |

**Validated Quote (Lines 341-343):**
> "The CSR at 20% goes red. 20 to 80, I think it's yellow and then it goes green."

---

## 🎓 Best Practices & Tips

### For Company Owners

**Do:**
- ✅ Upload all three core documents immediately after account creation
- ✅ Add Safe Work Procedures relevant to your work types (window washing, pressure washing, etc.)
- ✅ Check CSR dashboard weekly to catch gaps early
- ✅ Follow up with new hires within first week to sign all documents
- ✅ Make harness inspection part of the non-negotiable morning routine

**Don't:**
- ❌ Add documents without a plan to get them signed (temporarily lowers score)
- ❌ Ignore yellow warnings thinking they'll fix themselves
- ❌ Wait until WorkSafe shows up to care about compliance
- ❌ Blame technicians for low scores without providing the systems to succeed

---

### For Technicians

**Do:**
- ✅ Complete harness inspection every day before starting work
- ✅ Sign new documents promptly when notified
- ✅ Access safety documents in the app when you have questions
- ✅ Report issues with equipment through proper channels

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip harness inspection because you're "in a hurry"
- ❌ Ignore document signature requests
- ❌ Assume someone else will handle safety documentation

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why does my score start at 75% instead of 100%?"

**Answer:** The 75% starting point reflects that a new company hasn't yet proven their safety documentation is in place. Uploading your three core documents (COI, Health & Safety Manual, Company Policy) immediately brings you to 100%.

**Why this design:** It incentivizes completing basic setup quickly and shows property managers that documentation is verified, not assumed.

---

### "Why did my score drop after I added Safe Work Procedures?"

**Answer:** When you add new documents that require employee signatures, your score temporarily decreases until all employees have reviewed and signed them. Once everyone signs, your score returns to full.

**Why this design:** Adding a document without ensuring employees read it provides no real safety benefit. The temporary drop ensures documents are actually acknowledged, not just uploaded.

---

### "Can I ever reach a perfect 100% score?"

**Answer:** Yes, but maintaining it long-term is very difficult by design. Missing even one harness inspection out of thousands of sessions will slightly reduce your score.

**Why this design:** "Nobody is 100% safe. That would just be a lie." (Line 275) The system acknowledges that perfection is impossible while rewarding consistent compliance.

---

### "Who can see my company's CSR?"

**Answer:** Company owners see full detail. Technicians can see company scores when evaluating employers. Property managers see scores in their vendor dashboard. Building managers and residents cannot see CSR.

**Why this design:** CSR is a vendor selection tool for property managers and a management tool for owners. Building managers handle logistics, not vendor selection. Residents would have concerns without context.

---

### "How does one missed harness inspection affect my score?"

**Answer:** It depends on your total work session count. If you have 1 session and miss 1 inspection, that's 100% penalty in the harness category. If you have 1,000 sessions and miss 1, that's only 0.1% penalty.

**Why this design:** Long-term consistent compliance matters more than occasional lapses. New companies feel the impact more, incentivizing good habits from the start.

---

### "What if I do non-rope jobs that don't need anchor inspection?"

**Answer:** The system recognizes job types. Non-rope work (parkade pressure washing, ground-level tasks) doesn't require anchor inspection, so missing it won't affect your score for those projects.

**Why this design:** Penalties should reflect actual safety requirements. Requiring anchor inspection for ground-level work would be nonsensical.

## 🏆 Summary: Why CSR Is Different

**Most safety software treats compliance as checkbox exercises.** OnRopePro recognizes that in rope access, safety documentation is the **foundation of your entire operation** connecting:

1. **Documentation** → Proof you have policies
2. **Signatures** → Proof employees know policies
3. **Daily Practices** → Proof policies are followed
4. **Visibility** → Proof to clients you're trustworthy
5. **Accountability** → Proof to yourself you're improving

**When you use CSR, you're not just checking boxes. You're building a documented safety culture that protects your workers, your business, and your reputation.**

**Validated Quote (Lines 416):**
> "CSR is like, it goes through the entire app type of thing. It's like a fundamental component of the app itself and of the business... It is one of the nucleus modules."
