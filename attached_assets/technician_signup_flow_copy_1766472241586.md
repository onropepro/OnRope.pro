## PAGE 4: EMPLOYER CONNECTION VALUE

### Page Purpose
Show techs how their account transforms when connected to an employer on OnRopePro. This is the "supercharge" moment.

---

### Headline Options

**Option A (Transformation):**
```
Good alone. Unstoppable together.
```

**Option B (Before/After):**
```
Your account just leveled up.
```

**Option C (Direct):**
```
Here's what changes when your employer uses OnRopePro
```

---

### Subheadline
```
Everything you do manually? Now it's automatic.
```

---

### Two-Column Comparison: SOLO vs CONNECTED

**Visual approach:** Show the transformation from manual to automatic

| Without Employer on Platform | With Employer on Platform |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| You log hours manually | Hours log automatically when you clock in/out |
| You enter building details yourself | Building, height, tasks captured automatically |
| You track your own certifications | Employer sees your cert status instantly |
| You fill out safety forms on paper | Digital safety forms push to your phone |
| Onboarding = 60 minutes of paperwork | Onboarding = 10 seconds, one click |
| You chase supervisors for signatures | Digital sign-offs happen in real-time |
| You store your own inspection records | Harness inspections auto-credit your Safety Rating |
| Your resume is a PDF you email around | Employers verify your profile instantly |
