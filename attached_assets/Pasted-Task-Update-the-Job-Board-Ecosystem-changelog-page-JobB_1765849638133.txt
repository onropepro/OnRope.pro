Task: Update the Job Board Ecosystem changelog page (JobBoardGuide.tsx) using the attached content document.
Context: The current JobBoardGuide.tsx (v1.0, December 10, 2025) was reviewed against a conversation transcript between Tommy and Glenn (December 15, 2025) and the MODULE_DOCUMENTATION_SKELETON_FRAMEWORK. Several critical gaps were identified.
What Was Missing from v1.0:

Golden Rule - No core principle or value proposition statement
Key Features Summary - No quick-reference feature grid
Problems Solved Section - Entirely missing (required by skeleton framework)
Expected Pay Rate - Technicians can set their rate, visible to employers before contact (not documented)
Direct Job Offers - Employers can send offers from Talent Browser linked to active job postings (not documented)
Job Offer Notifications - Technicians receive in-portal notifications to accept/decline (not documented)
Closed-Garden Value Proposition - The core differentiator vs Indeed/Craigslist was not emphasized
Indeed Cost Comparison - $22/application fee structure not mentioned
Why It's Different - No competitive positioning section
Integration Points - No documentation of how Job Board connects to other modules
Best Practices - No Do's/Don'ts for employers or technicians
FAQ Section - No common questions answered
Measurable Results - No before/after metrics
