# Property Manager Portal Landing Page Copy

**Version:** 2.0  
**Created:** December 18, 2025  
**Updated:** December 18, 2025  
**Target Audience:** Building-Level Operations Managers + Portfolio Property Managers  
**Module:** Property Manager Interface  

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Solution-aware (know they need vendor visibility tools but may not know OnRopePro)

**Core Insights (Dual):**
1. **Risk/Liability:** Property managers carry invisible liability risk with every rope access vendor they hire. When something goes wrong, the first question is always: "What due diligence did you perform?" Most have nothing documented.
2. **Complaint Elimination:** Property managers are currently the complaint relay between residents and vendors. When vendors use OnRopePro, residents submit complaints directly to the vendor. Property managers are removed from the loop entirely while maintaining full visibility.

**Psychological Frameworks Used:**
- Loss Aversion (avoiding $10-29M liability exposure)
- Relief/Burden Elimination (complaints no longer route through you)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (oversight without involvement)
- Time Savings (stop being the middleman for 50+ buildings)
- Professional Identity (looking competent to boards)
- Authority/Transparency (seeing what was previously invisible)

**Emotional Territory:** Relief from hidden risk + freedom from complaint burden + professional competence validation

4. "What If Resident Complaints Stopped Landing on Your Desk?"
5. "Your Vendors Have Safety Records. Your Residents Have a Direct Line. You Have Visibility."

### Subheadline

---

## Opening Hook Section

### Option A: Complaint Elimination Hook (Recommended for Building Managers)

How many resident complaints did you relay to vendors last month?

Every streaky window, every scheduling question, every "when are they coming to my side of the building?" lands on your desk first. You forward it. You follow up. You relay the response. You're the middleman for every issue on every building you manage.

What if complaints went directly to your vendor instead?

When your vendors use OnRopePro, residents submit feedback straight to them. You see everything: what was reported, when it was viewed, how fast it was resolved. But you're not in the middle of it anymore.

Oversight without involvement. That's the Property Manager Portal.

**[CTA: Create Your Free Account]**

---

### Option B: Risk Mitigation Hook (Recommended for Portfolio Managers)

When a rope access technician falls, the first question isn't "Is everyone okay?"

It's "Did you verify this contractor's safety compliance before hiring them?"

If your answer is "I checked their insurance certificate" or worse, "I took their word for it," you're exposed.

The Property Manager Portal gives you documented evidence of vendor safety due diligence. Before something goes wrong.

**[CTA: Create Your Free Account]**

---

### Option C: Combined Hook (Recommended for Mixed Audiences)

You manage 30 buildings. Each one generates resident complaints about maintenance work. Each complaint routes through you to the vendor and back again.

Meanwhile, you have no idea which vendors actually follow safety protocols. You're picking contractors based on price and hoping for the best.

The Property Manager Portal fixes both problems:

Residents submit complaints directly to vendors. You're out of the loop.
Vendor safety ratings show you who's actually compliant. You're informed.

Oversight without involvement. Visibility without liability.

## What You Get Section

### Section Headline

**Out of the Complaint Loop. Into the Know.**

### Feature Blocks

**Residents Complain Directly to Vendors. Not to You.**

This is the big one.

When your vendors use OnRopePro, residents get access to a Resident Portal. They submit complaints with photos directly to the maintenance company. The vendor responds. The issue gets resolved.

You're not in the middle of it. You're not the relay. You're not spending your Tuesday forwarding emails and making follow-up calls.

But you see everything. Every complaint. Every response. Every resolution. Complete visibility without being the middleman.

For a property manager handling 50 buildings, this is the difference between drowning in complaint coordination and actually managing properties.

---

**Response Time Metrics: The Accountability You've Been Missing**

When residents complain directly to vendors, vendors can ignore them. Or they can respond in 24 hours.

Now you know which.

The Property Manager Portal shows average resolution times and feedback response rates for every contractor. When you see a vendor taking 12 days to respond while another resolves issues in 2 days, you have data for your next contract conversation.

This is what Tommy (our co-founder, 15 years in rope access) says property managers care about most: "This will be a bigger factor than safety ratings. Are they actually responding to complaints?"

---

**Vendor Safety Ratings: Know Before Something Goes Wrong**

Every rope access company on OnRopePro has a Company Safety Rating (CSR) built from three compliance metrics: documentation completeness, toolbox meeting frequency, and harness inspection rates.

You see exactly where each vendor stands. No guessing. No asking for reports they can fabricate.

When an insurance adjuster asks "What did you know about this vendor's safety practices?", you have an answer.

---

**All Your Vendors. One Dashboard.**

Managing 20 buildings with different contractors? Finding which company services which building shouldn't require digging through emails and contracts.

The My Vendors Dashboard shows every contracted rope access company, their safety scores, their response times, and which of your buildings they service. Thirty seconds instead of twenty minutes.

---

**Feedback History Per Building**

That resident who complained about streaky windows three times? Track the entire conversation. See when the vendor responded, what they said, how long resolution took.

Building-by-building complaint and resolution history gives you documentation when performance conversations get difficult. Or when you're deciding whether to renew a contract.

---

**Anchor Inspection Certificate Upload**

Annual anchor inspections are required for rope access work. You receive the certificate from the third-party inspector. Now you have one place to store it.

Upload anchor inspection certificates directly to each building record. Your only write permission. Everything else is read-only for data integrity.

---

## The Complaint Flow Transformation

### Section Headline

**Before vs. After: Where Complaints Go**

### Before OnRopePro

```
Resident notices issue
    ↓
Resident calls/emails Property Manager
    ↓
Property Manager forwards to Vendor
    ↓
(wait)
    ↓
Vendor responds to Property Manager
    ↓
Property Manager relays to Resident
    ↓
Resident has follow-up question
    ↓
(repeat entire cycle)
```

You're the relay. Every complaint, every update, every follow-up routes through your inbox. Multiply by 50 buildings. That's your week.

### With OnRopePro

```
Resident notices issue
    ↓
Resident submits directly to Vendor (with photos)
    ↓
Vendor responds directly to Resident
    ↓
Issue resolved
```

**Where are you in this flow?**

Watching from your dashboard. You see every complaint that comes in, when it was viewed, how long resolution took. If a vendor is ignoring complaints, you'll know. If they're responding in 24 hours, you'll see that too.

But you're not in the middle of it. You're not the relay. You're not spending hours on complaint coordination.

You're the property manager with oversight. Not the complaint department.

---

## How It Works Section

### Section Headline

**Three Steps. Five Minutes. Free Forever.**

### Steps

**Step 1: Get Your Property Manager Code**

Ask your rope access vendor for a Property Manager Code. Any company using OnRopePro can generate one for you. Takes them 30 seconds.

---

**Step 2: Create Your Free Account**

Enter the code, create your account, and specify which buildings you manage. No credit card. No trial period. Free access. Period.

---

**Step 3: Watch Your Workload Shrink**

View safety ratings, response metrics, and complaint resolution data for every vendor servicing your buildings. See complaints being handled without your involvement. Compare contractors objectively. Make informed decisions.

When residents in your buildings start using the Resident Portal, complaints stop routing through you. You just see the results.

**[CTA: Create Your Free Account]**

---

## Why It's Free Section

### Section Headline

**Yes, It's Actually Free. Here's Why.**

### Body Copy

Your vendors pay for OnRopePro. You don't.

When property managers can see vendor safety ratings, contractors have powerful motivation to maintain high scores. Companies with strong safety records get more work. Companies with poor records lose contracts.

That transparency benefits everyone: safer work for technicians, better vendor selection for you, documented compliance for insurance purposes.

Your access isn't the product. Your visibility is what makes the product valuable.

**[CTA: Get Free Access]**

---

## Risk Mitigation Section

### Section Headline

**The Documentation You'll Wish You Had. Before You Need It.**

### Body Copy

Insurance audits. Liability claims. Board inquiries. Regulatory inspections.

They all ask the same question: "What did you know about your vendor's safety practices?"

The Property Manager Portal creates an automatic audit trail. Every time you check a vendor's CSR, view their response metrics, or compare contractors, that visibility is documented.

When someone asks what due diligence you performed, you have an answer.

When a competitor's building has an incident and the news asks "Could this happen here?", you have data showing exactly how your vendors compare.

---

## Social Proof / Vendor Accountability Section

### Section Headline

**When Vendors Know You're Watching, Everything Changes.**

### Body Copy

Here's what happens when you can see vendor response times:

The vendor who takes 12 days to respond to complaints knows you can see that. The vendor who resolves issues in 48 hours knows you can see that too.

An 86% safety rating versus a 23% safety rating tells a story. A 2-day average resolution time versus a 14-day average tells another.

When property managers can see these numbers, vendors can't hide behind vague assurances. The companies doing the work right finally have proof. The companies cutting corners or ignoring complaints get exposed.

Your visibility creates accountability. When vendors know their response times affect their contracts, responsiveness becomes a competitive advantage.

Better for residents. Better for you. Better for everyone who lives and works in your buildings.

---

## The Real Value: Your Time Back

### Section Headline

**What Would You Do With 10 Extra Hours a Week?**

### Body Copy

Property managers managing 30+ buildings spend 8-15 hours weekly on complaint coordination alone. Forwarding emails. Following up with vendors. Relaying responses. Chasing updates.

When complaints go directly to vendors:

Those hours disappear from your workload.

You still have full visibility. You still see response times. You still have documentation for board meetings and contract renewals. You just don't have to be the middleman anymore.

That's time back for lease renewals. For tenant relations. For the strategic work that actually grows your portfolio. For leaving at 5pm instead of 7pm.

The Property Manager Portal doesn't just give you data. It gives you your time back.

---

## Objection Handling Section

### "What if my vendors don't use OnRopePro?"

Ask them about it. Vendors who prioritize safety and responsiveness want property managers to see their ratings and resolution times. If they resist transparency, that tells you something.

You can also tell them: "I'd like to stop being the complaint relay between residents and your company. OnRopePro lets residents submit directly to you, and I get visibility into response times."

Most vendors will see that as a benefit, not a burden.

### "What if residents keep complaining to me anyway?"

Redirect them. "Submit your feedback through the Resident Portal. The vendor will see it immediately and respond directly. I can see everything you submit, but they'll respond faster if you go directly."

Most residents prefer direct access over waiting for you to relay messages. The system trains the behavior quickly.

### "I don't want to lose visibility into what's happening at my buildings."

You won't. That's the point.

You see every complaint that comes in, when it was viewed, when it was resolved, what the vendor said. You have complete visibility into the entire conversation.

You just don't have to be IN the conversation anymore. Oversight without involvement.

### "I already track vendor certificates in spreadsheets."

Certificates confirm insurance exists. They don't tell you if workers are actually following safety protocols. CSR shows real-time compliance, not paperwork.

And spreadsheets don't route complaints directly to vendors. They don't show you response time metrics. They don't give you the data you need for contract decisions.

### "This seems too good to be free."

Your vendors pay for the platform. Your access creates the visibility that makes their investment valuable. There's no catch because you're not the customer. You're the accountability mechanism that makes the system work.

### "I need to check with my portfolio manager first."

Show them this page. The ROI argument writes itself: 

Free access. Complaint elimination. Vendor accountability data. Liability documentation. No budget required.

What's the counterargument?

---
