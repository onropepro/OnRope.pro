# Property Manager Portal Landing Page Copy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** December 18, 2025  
**Target Audience:** Building-Level Operations Managers + Portfolio Property Managers  
**Module:** Property Manager Interface  

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Solution-aware (know they need vendor visibility tools but may not know OnRopePro)

**Core Insight:** Property managers carry invisible liability risk with every rope access vendor they hire. When something goes wrong, the first question is always: "What due diligence did you perform?" Most have nothing documented.

**Psychological Frameworks Used:**
- Loss Aversion (avoiding $10-29M liability exposure)
- Risk Mitigation (insurance and legal protection)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one dashboard vs. scattered info)
- Professional Identity (looking competent to boards)
- Authority/Transparency (seeing what was previously invisible)
- Social Proof (vendor accountability through visibility)

**Emotional Territory:** Relief from hidden risk + professional competence validation + simplification

## Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Know Your Vendors. Protect Your Buildings.**

### Alternative Headlines (A/B Testing Options)

1. "See What Your Rope Access Vendors Don't Want You to See"
2. "Stop Guessing About Vendor Safety. Start Knowing."
3. "The Free Dashboard That Shows Which Vendors Actually Follow Safety Protocols"
4. "One Question Insurance Adjusters Always Ask: 'What Did You Know About Your Vendor?'"
5. "Your Vendors Have Safety Records. You Should See Them."

### Subheadline

---

## Opening Hook Section

### Option A: Loss Aversion Hook (Recommended)

When a rope access technician falls, the first question isn't "Is everyone okay?"

It's "Did you verify this contractor's safety compliance before hiring them?"

If your answer is "I checked their insurance certificate" or worse, "I took their word for it," you're exposed.

The Property Manager Portal gives you documented evidence of vendor safety due diligence. Before something goes wrong.

### Option B: Professional Identity Hook

Your board asks: "How do we know all our vendors are safe?"

You can guess. Or you can show them the data.

The Property Manager Portal puts vendor safety ratings, response metrics, and compliance history at your fingertips. When someone questions your vendor decisions, you have answers.

**[CTA: Get Free Access Now]**

---

### Option C: Comparison Hook

Two vendors. Same price. Same project scope.

One has an 86% safety rating. The other has a 23%.

Right now, you have no way to know which is which. You pick based on price and hope.

The Property Manager Portal makes this invisible data visible.

**[CTA: See Your Vendors' Real Ratings]**

---

## What You Get Section

### Section Headline

**Everything You Need to Know About Your Rope Access Vendors. In One Place.**

### Feature Blocks

**Vendor Safety Ratings**

Every rope access company on OnRopePro has a Company Safety Rating (CSR) built from three compliance metrics: documentation completeness, toolbox meeting frequency, and harness inspection rates.

You see exactly where each vendor stands. No guessing. No asking for reports they can fabricate.

---

**Response Time Metrics**

When you report a complaint, does your vendor actually fix it? Now you know.

See average resolution times and feedback response rates for every contractor. Hold vendors accountable with data, not arguments.

---

**All Your Vendors. One Dashboard.**

Managing 20 buildings with different contractors? Finding which company services which building shouldn't require digging through emails and contracts.

The My Vendors Dashboard shows every contracted rope access company, their safety scores, and which of your buildings they service. Thirty seconds instead of twenty minutes.

---

**Feedback History**

That resident who complained about streaky windows? Track whether your vendor responded, how long it took, and what they did.

Building-by-building complaint and resolution history gives you documentation when performance conversations get difficult.

---

**Anchor Inspection Certificate Upload**

Annual anchor inspections are required for rope access work. You receive the certificate from the third-party inspector. Now you have one place to store it.

Upload anchor inspection certificates directly to each building record. Your only write permission. Everything else is read-only for data integrity.

---

## How It Works Section

### Section Headline

**Three Steps. Five Minutes. Free Forever.**

### Steps

**Step 1: Get Your Property Manager Code**

Ask your rope access vendor for a Property Manager Code. Any company using OnRopePro can generate one for you. Takes them 30 seconds.

---

**Step 2: Create Your Free Account**

Enter the code, create your account, and specify which buildings you manage. No credit card. No trial period. Free access. Period.

---

**Step 3: See What You've Been Missing**

View safety ratings, response metrics, and compliance data for every vendor servicing your buildings. Compare contractors objectively. Make informed decisions.

**[CTA: Create Your Free Account]**

## Why It's Free Section

### Section Headline

**Yes, It's Actually Free. Here's Why.**

### Body Copy

Your vendors pay for OnRopePro. You don't.

When property managers can see vendor safety ratings, contractors have powerful motivation to maintain high scores. Companies with strong safety records get more work. Companies with poor records lose contracts.

That transparency benefits everyone: safer work for technicians, better vendor selection for you, documented compliance for insurance purposes.

Your access isn't the product. Your visibility is what makes the product valuable.

**[CTA: Get Free Access]**

---

## Risk Mitigation Section

### Section Headline

**The Documentation You'll Wish You Had. Before You Need It.**

### Body Copy

Insurance audits. Liability claims. Board inquiries. Regulatory inspections.

They all ask the same question: "What did you know about your vendor's safety practices?"

The Property Manager Portal creates an automatic audit trail. Every time you check a vendor's CSR, view their response metrics, or compare contractors, that visibility is documented.

When someone asks what due diligence you performed, you have an answer.

When a competitor's building has an incident and the news asks "Could this happen here?", you have data showing exactly how your vendors compare.

---

## Social Proof / Vendor Accountability Section

### Section Headline

**When Vendors Know You're Watching, Standards Rise.**

### Body Copy

An 86% safety rating versus a 23% safety rating tells a story.

When property managers can see these numbers, vendors can't hide behind vague assurances. The companies doing the work right finally have proof. The companies cutting corners get exposed.

Your visibility creates accountability. When vendors know their CSR affects their contracts, safety becomes a competitive advantage, not a cost center.

Better for technicians. Better for you. Better for everyone who lives and works in your buildings.

---

## Objection Handling Section

### "What if my vendors don't use OnRopePro?"

Ask them about it. Vendors who prioritize safety want property managers to see their ratings. If they resist transparency, that tells you something.

### "I already track vendor certificates in spreadsheets."

Certificates confirm insurance exists. They don't tell you if workers are actually following safety protocols. CSR shows real-time compliance, not paperwork.

### "This seems too good to be free."

Your vendors pay for the platform. Your access creates the visibility that makes their investment valuable. There's no catch because you're not the customer. You're the accountability mechanism.

### "I need to check with my portfolio manager first."

Show them this page. The ROI argument writes itself: free access to data that protects against liability and improves vendor selection. No budget required.

---

## Final CTA Section

### Headline

**See Your Vendors Differently.**

### Body Copy

You already manage rope access contractors. You just can't see what they're actually doing.

The Property Manager Portal makes the invisible visible. Safety ratings. Response metrics. Compliance trends. Documentation for when you need it.

Free. No credit card. No trial expiration.

Just ask your vendor for a Property Manager Code and create your account.

## A/B Test Recommendations

**Test 1: Headline Approach**
- Loss aversion ("Know Your Vendors. Protect Your Buildings.") vs. Professional identity ("The Dashboard Your Board Will Ask About") vs. Curiosity ("What Your Vendors Don't Want You to See")
- Why: Different emotional triggers resonate with different segments (building managers vs. portfolio managers)

**Test 2: Opening Hook**
- Long-form story hook (technician fall scenario) vs. Short direct hook (board question scenario)
- Why: Portfolio managers may prefer direct; building managers may connect with scenario-based

**Test 3: CTA Language**
- "Create Your Free Account" vs. "Get Free Access" vs. "See Your Vendors' Ratings"
- Why: Testing action-oriented vs. benefit-oriented CTA language

**Test 4: Free Positioning**
- Lead with "free" prominently vs. Lead with value, reveal free later
- Why: "Free" can attract or create skepticism depending on audience

---

## Writing Guidelines Applied

- No em-dashes (TSX compatibility)
- Active voice throughout
- Present tense
- "You" language (not "property managers" in third person)
- Specific numbers when available (86% vs 23%, 30 seconds, 20 minutes)
- Conversational but professional tone
- Benefit-focused, not feature-dumping
- Addresses both building-level and portfolio-level managers
