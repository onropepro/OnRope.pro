## Overview

The Company Safety Rating (CSR) is a penalty-based compliance scoring system that provides an empirical measurement of your company's safety posture. Property managers can view a company's CSR score to assess vendor reliability, while company owners gain real-time visibility into their actual safety compliance.

> **Important:** CSR starts at **75%** and reaches **100%** as soon as your company uploads the three core documents: Certificate of Insurance (COI), Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy.

## The Golden Rule

> **CSR is not just a number for property managers. It is an empirical way to build safety into your company culture.**

The CSR transforms safety from "be safe out there" into measurable accountability. It tells property managers you're a safe company, but more importantly, it tells you as a company owner how safe your business actually is.

## Problems Solved

### For Company Owners

**"I know I should be safer, but I don't have time to create all the paperwork"**

OnRopePro provides pre-made templates for Safe Work Procedures and Safe Work Practices. Add documents in 2 minutes, send notification to all employees, each tech signs in 1 minute per document. What would take days of administrative work becomes a quick task with full documentation trail.

**"When WorkSafe shows up, I can't prove my employees know the procedures"**

Export a PDF report showing all employee signatures with timestamps for every safety document. When WorkSafe asks "How do you know your employee saw it?", you have immediate proof. Transform a multi-day compliance nightmare into instant verification.

**"I don't know how safe my company actually is"**

CSR provides a single number showing your safety posture instantly. Score drops? You know immediately something needs attention. Move from "I think we're safe" to "I know we're 87% compliant, and here's exactly what needs improvement."

**"Property managers are choosing competitors over me"**

Your 87% CSR rating versus a competitor's 35% rating becomes a decisive factor in vendor selection. Convert your actual safety investment into a competitive advantage that wins contracts.

### For Rope Access Technicians

**"I don't know if this company is actually safe to work for"**

CSR is visible to technicians evaluating job offers. Before accepting a position, you can see the company's safety rating. Would you rather work for a company with a 40 CSR or a 95 CSR? Your life is on the line.

**"I need access to safety documents on the job site"**

All signed safety documents are accessible in the app. Need to check company policy on working alone? It's right there, anytime you need it.

### For Property Managers

**"I can't objectively compare vendor safety"**

View each vendor's CSR through the "My Vendors" dashboard. Color-coded badges (green/yellow/red) provide instant assessment for data-driven vendor decisions.

## How CSR Works

### Starting Score

CSR starts at **75%** for new companies. Upload your three core documents to reach 100%:

- Certificate of Insurance (COI)
- Health & Safety Manual
- Company Policy

### Safe Work Documents Impact

When you add Safe Work Procedures or Safe Work Practices templates, your score temporarily decreases until all employees review and sign those documents. Once signed, your score returns to full compliance. This ensures every team member has actually read and acknowledged your safety policies.

---

## Penalty Categories

### Documentation Penalty (Max 25%)

Deducted for missing essential company documents:

- Certificate of Insurance (COI)
- Health & Safety Manual
- Company Policy

### Project Documents Penalty (Max 25%)

Each project requires four safety documents. Missing documents impact your score proportionally:

- Anchor Inspection (waived for non-rope jobs like parkade pressure washing)
- Rope Access Plan
- Toolbox Meeting
- Field Level Hazard Assessment (FLHA)

### Harness Inspection Penalty (Max 25%)

Based on inspection completion rate across all work sessions:

- Each work session should have a corresponding harness inspection
- Inspections completed before starting work each day
- Penalty calculated as percentage of missing inspections

**How it calculates:** The penalty is a straight percentage. If 1 of 1 inspections is missing, that's 100% penalty in this category. If 1 of 100 is missing, that's 1%. If 20 of 100 are missing, that's 20%. As your company accumulates more work sessions, each individual miss has proportionally less impact.

### Document Review Penalty (Max 5%)

Unsigned employee acknowledgments for:

- Health & Safety Manual
- Company Policy
- Safe Work Procedures
- Safe Work Practices

## CSR Visibility

### Who Can See CSR

**Property Managers:** Overall CSR percentage badge with color indicator, breakdown by category, accessible through "My Vendors" dashboard

**Company Owners:** Full dashboard showing overall score, category breakdowns with specific metrics (e.g., "3 of 7 work days covered"), prioritized improvement tips

**Technicians:** Can view company CSR when evaluating job offers or employers

### Who Cannot See CSR

**Building Managers:** They handle logistics (keys, water access, site coordination), not vendor selection

**Residents:** Would create unnecessary concerns and complaints

## Color-Coded Badge System

Your CSR displays as a color-coded badge indicating compliance level:

| Score Range | Color | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| 90-100% | 🟢 Green | Excellent |
| 70-89% | 🟡 Yellow | Good |
| 50-69% | 🟠 Orange | Warning |
| Below 50% | 🔴 Red | Critical |

---

## Improving Your CSR

### Upload Required Documents

Ensure COI, Health & Safety Manual, and Company Policy are uploaded and current. This brings your baseline score to 100%.

### Complete Project Documentation

For each project, ensure all four required documents are completed:
- Anchor Inspection (for rope access jobs)
- Rope Access Plan
- Toolbox Meeting
- FLHA

### Require Harness Inspections

Ensure technicians complete harness inspections before starting work each day. Consistent daily compliance builds your score over time.

### Employee Document Sign-Off

Have all employees acknowledge required safety documents through the Documents page. When you add new documents, follow up to ensure everyone signs promptly.

## Key Insight: Nobody Is 100% Safe

The CSR system is designed so that perfect 100% scores are extremely difficult to maintain long-term. This is intentional. If it were possible to always be at 100%, safety procedures wouldn't be necessary.

The goal is continuous improvement and accountability, not perfection. A company with a consistent 85-95% demonstrates genuine safety commitment far better than a theoretical "perfect" score.

## Future Enhancements

**CSR Impact Logging:** Track where and when your company gained or lost rating points, with specific actions tied to score changes.

**Training Area:** Watch safety videos, complete quizzes, listen to podcasts to actively improve your CSR through demonstrated learning.

---

## Summary

The CSR is one of OnRopePro's nucleus modules, fundamental to the entire platform's purpose. It transforms rope access safety from an honor system into an accountable, measurable metric that benefits everyone:

- **Owners** know their actual safety posture
- **Technicians** can evaluate employer safety before accepting jobs
- **Property Managers** can make data-driven vendor decisions
- **The Industry** becomes measurably safer

When you use OnRopePro's safety features, you're not just checking boxes. You're building a documented safety culture that protects your workers, your business, and your reputation.
