### Tipping Point Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold | Why It Matters | How to Measure |

| **Marketplace Behavior** | Active vendor comparison | True marketplace dynamics | PM behavior analytics |
| **Trust Score Adoption** | 80% vendors rated | Quality signal established | Rated vendor % |

### Transaction Fee Model (Conceptual)

| Fee Type | Rate | Applied To | Est. Y4 Revenue |
|----------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Booking Fee** | 2.5% | PM-sourced projects | $150K |
| **Payment Processing** | 1.5% | Platform payments | $100K |
| **Premium Placement** | $99/mo | Featured vendor listing | $50K |
| **Lead Fee** | $25/lead | Qualified PM introductions | $75K |

**Why Wait:** Transaction fees require marketplace behavior. Launching too early creates friction before network effects mature. Focus Year 1-3 on subscription revenue; introduce transaction fees Year 4+ when platform becomes true marketplace.

3. **Can we execute this with 2 humans + AI, or does it require hiring?**
4. **What's the minimum viable version we could launch to test demand?**

## Part 10: Risk Triggers (When to Pivot)

**Document Status:** KPI & Tipping Points Framework v1.0  
**Next Review:** Q1 Year 1 (post-launch)

**Key Principle:** Every major decision has quantifiable triggers. No launches based on intuition alone — let the data tell us when the market is ready.

**The Account Hierarchy:**
1. Buildings (the moat) — auto-created, always free
2. Techs (the network) — free → $14.99/mo premium
3. Employers (the revenue) — $299-$1,999/mo (4 tiers)
4. Building Managers (single building) — ✅ Built, **FREE FOREVER**
5. Property Managers (multi-building) — ✅ Built, free now → $49/bldg/mo premium (features TBD)
