## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware (know payroll consumes hours, seeking better approach)

**Core Insight:** The 6 hours you spend on payroll isn't just lost time. It's the domino that knocks over your whole operation. Late payments breed a culture where deadlines are suggestions.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Loss Aversion** - Stop bleeding hours, money, and trust every pay period
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - One system, zero calculator, no paper shuffling
3. **Identity Alignment** - Professional operations don't circle numbers with pens
4. **Future Pacing** - Imagine payroll taking 30 minutes instead of 6 hours

**Emotional Territory:** Relief (the dreaded task becomes trivial)

## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline
**Stop Circling Numbers With a Pen**

### Alternative Headlines
1. **Payroll Day Shouldn't Take All Day**
2. **From 6 Hours to 30 Minutes. Every Pay Period.**
3. **Your Desk Covered in Timesheets? Fix That.**

### Subheadline
Work sessions flow directly into payroll-ready timesheets. No paper. No calculator. No circling. Export to QuickBooks, ADP, or Gusto in minutes.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**The Payroll Problem Nobody Admits**

### Body Copy
You print timesheets. One employee's data spreads across four pages. Twelve employees means 48 pages minimum. You lay them across your desk, circle hours with a pen, and grab a calculator.

Three hours later, you're still not done. And you've probably made a mistake you won't catch until the employee calls asking why they're short $130.

So you send a quick e-transfer. Problem solved for them. Problem created for your books. Your bookkeeper asks what that random payment was. Now you're explaining instead of running your company.

This chaos doesn't stay contained. When payroll is painful, you put it off. When you're consistently late, your team notices. A culture forms where deadlines are optional. That mindset bleeds into everything.

OnRopePro eliminates manual entry between field work and payroll. Every clock-in becomes payroll data automatically. GPS-verified. Project-attributed. Overtime-calculated. Ready to export.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header
**From Clock-In to Payroll Export**

### Intro Copy
The Payroll & Financial module transforms scattered work session data into organized, exportable timesheets without manual intervention.

### Card 1: Automatic Aggregation
Every GPS-verified clock-in flows directly into timesheets. The system calculates hours, applies overtime rules, and groups everything by pay period.

**What gets automated:**
- Regular hour totals by employee
- Overtime calculation (daily and weekly triggers)
- Pay period grouping (weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly)
- Project attribution per work session

### Card 2: Job Costing Visibility
Know exactly how many hours went to each building. Stop underbidding jobs because you can finally see where time actually goes.

**What gets tracked:**
- Hours per project per employee
- Billable vs non-billable breakdown
- Project labor cost totals
- Historical comparison across pay periods

### Card 3: Export-Ready Output
Generate CSV files for QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, or any payroll software. PDF reports for records. No re-keying data.

**What gets exported:**
- Employee-by-employee timesheets
- Project cost breakdowns
- Overtime summaries
- Complete audit trails

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Reclaim 5+ hours every pay period.** The calculator and pen method costs you 6-10 hours per payroll run. OnRopePro aggregates everything automatically. Select the pay period. Review the totals. Export. Done in 30-45 minutes.

**Stop the random e-transfer scramble.** When timesheets are wrong, you fix it with quick payments that confuse your books. Accurate data from the start means no corrections. Your bookkeeper gets clean exports every time.

**Quote jobs with confidence.** You underbid that building by 60 hours because you couldn't see where time went. Project attribution shows exactly how long each job takes. Your next quote includes the hours you actually need.

### For Operations Managers & Supervisors

**Review without the paper shuffle.** Your employees across multiple projects, multiple buildings, multiple shifts. The payroll view shows every work session organized by employee and pay period. Review and approve from one screen.

**Catch discrepancies before payday.** GPS verification and project attribution make anomalies obvious. A technician logged 8 hours at Building A but was scheduled for Building B? You see it immediately.

**Historical access for audits.** Previous pay periods stay accessible. When someone questions hours from three months ago, you pull the data in seconds.

### For Rope Access Technicians

**Your hours are accurate.** GPS verification captures your actual time on site. No more discrepancies between what you logged and what the owner calculated.

**See where your time goes.** Every work session shows which project you were assigned to. Your 8-hour day might split across three buildings. The breakdown is clear.

**Overtime calculated correctly.** The system applies your company's overtime rules automatically. Daily trigger at 8 hours, weekly trigger at 40, whatever the configuration. No manual math required.

### For Building Managers/Property Managers

**Labor documentation on demand.** Need to verify how many technician hours were spent on your building last quarter? The data exists and exports cleanly.

**Budget validation simplified.** You contracted for 200 hours of annual maintenance. The project attribution shows exactly how many hours have been logged against your building.

**Audit-ready records.** Insurance, compliance, or internal review requirements? Work session data with GPS verification provides the documentation trail.

### Additional Considerations (Technical/Accounting)

**Clean data for your books.** Every transaction is documented before export. No unexplained corrections to reconcile. No random e-transfers to categorize.

**Flexible overtime configuration.** Daily triggers, weekly triggers, custom thresholds. 1.5x, 2x, or 3x multipliers. Disable overtime entirely if your structure doesn't require it. Match your jurisdiction's requirements.

**Permission-controlled access.** Financial data visible only to users with canAccessFinancials permission. Technicians see their own hours. Sensitive compensation data stays protected.

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy
Every feature exists to eliminate the gap between field work and payroll processing.

### Feature 1: Pay Period Configuration
Choose weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly pay periods. The system auto-generates period boundaries based on your selection. Work sessions group into the correct pay period automatically.

### Feature 2: GPS-Verified Time Data
Hours come from verified work sessions, not self-reported notebooks. Clock-in location confirms the technician was actually at the job site. Eliminates disputes about "he said she said" hours.

### Feature 3: Configurable Overtime Rules
Set daily triggers (default 8 hours), weekly triggers (default 40 hours), or custom thresholds. Multipliers adjust from 1.5x to 3x. Disable overtime entirely for companies without OT structures.

### Feature 4: Project Attribution
Every work session links to a specific project. Your payroll view shows which building, which job type, how many hours. Essential for job costing and future bid accuracy.

### Feature 5: Billable vs Non-Billable Tracking
Distinguish revenue-generating client hours from operational costs. Travel between sites, equipment maintenance, training, weather delays. Know your true labor cost, not just hours worked.

### Feature 6: Export Capabilities
CSV export for payroll software integration (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto). PDF timesheet reports for records. Employee-level detail and project cost breakdowns available.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Rope Access Company Owners

**"I spend every payday printing timesheets and circling numbers."**

You print everyone's timesheets. Each employee's data spreads across multiple pages. You grab a pen, circle the hours, then use a calculator to total everything. This takes 2-3 hours minimum, and mistakes still happen.

OnRopePro aggregates work session data into employee-by-employee timesheets automatically. No printing. No circling. No calculator. Select the pay period, review the summary, export the file.

**"Random e-transfers keep confusing my bookkeeper."**

When you short someone, you fix it with a quick payment. Your bookkeeper sees unexplained transactions and has to track you down. You explain it was a payroll correction. They manually adjust the records.

Accurate timesheets from the start eliminate corrections. Every transaction is documented in the system before export. Your bookkeeper gets clean data.

**"I have no idea why that job went 60 hours over budget."**

You quoted 200 hours. The job took 260. But you don't know which days went long, which employees, or whether scope expanded. Without project-level data, you can't learn. Next year, same mistake.

Project attribution tracks exactly where hours went. You see the breakdown by building, by employee, by day. Adjust future quotes based on actual data.

### For Operations Managers & Supervisors

**"I'm constantly reconciling hours between three systems."**

Your technicians track hours in notebooks. Your time clock shows different numbers. You're the one who has to figure out which is right before payroll.

OnRopePro creates one source of truth. Work sessions capture actual time with GPS verification. No conflicting systems.

**"Payroll review takes my whole afternoon."**

Pulling data from multiple places, cross-referencing against schedules, checking for anomalies. The administrative burden of payroll preparation is substantial.

The payroll view shows all work sessions organized by employee and pay period. Review everything from one screen. Approve and export.

### For Rope Access Technicians

**"I got shorted because the time clock didn't capture my full day."**

The owner sent you home early but said he'd pay you for the full 8. The time clock showed 4 hours. He processed based on the clock. Now you're owed money.

Work sessions capture what actually happened. Manager overrides are documented with reasons. No discrepancy between systems.

**"I don't know how my overtime is being calculated."**

Is it daily? Weekly? What's the multiplier? When mistakes happen, you don't have visibility into the calculation.

Overtime rules are configured at the company level and applied automatically. Your timesheet shows regular hours and overtime hours separately.

### For Building Managers/Property Managers

**"I can't verify how many labor hours actually went to my building."**

You contracted for quarterly maintenance. The invoice says 180 hours. You have no way to confirm that's accurate.

Project attribution logs every work session against specific buildings. The labor breakdown is available for any project.

### Additional Considerations (Technical/Accounting)

**"Export files require manual cleanup before I can import them."**

Your current system exports data in a format your payroll software doesn't understand. You spend time reformatting before every import.

CSV exports are formatted for direct import into QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, and similar payroll software. No cleanup required.

**"I need historical payroll data for an audit and can't find it."**

Records from six months ago? Buried in spreadsheets or not documented at all. Reconstructing the data takes hours.

Historical pay periods remain accessible in the system. Filter by date range, pull the data, export the report.

## 7. Measurable Results

### Time Savings
The manual pen-and-calculator method consumes 6-10 hours per payroll run. OnRopePro reduces this to 30-45 minutes. For bi-weekly payroll, that's approximately 260 hours saved annually. Time that goes back into running your business.

### Error Reduction
Conflicting systems (notebooks, time clocks, spreadsheets) create discrepancies. Single-source-of-truth data eliminates reconciliation disputes. Corrections drop dramatically when the data is accurate from the start.

### Job Costing Accuracy
Without project attribution, you don't know why jobs run over budget. With it, you see exactly where hours went. Operators report quoting accuracy improves because they're working from actual historical data instead of estimates.

### Accounting Cleanliness
Random correction payments create unexplained transactions. Clean exports mean every dollar is documented before it leaves the system. Bookkeeper reconciliation time drops.

## 8. Module Integration Points

### Intro Copy
The Payroll & Financial module connects with other OnRopePro modules to create a complete data pipeline from field work to payroll export.

### Work Sessions & Time Tracking
Primary data source. Every clock-in and clock-out creates work session data that flows directly into payroll aggregation. Start time, end time, GPS location, project assignment, and break time feed the timesheet generation.

### Employee Management
Rate and role lookup. Hourly rate pulls from the employee profile at the time of the work session. Mid-project rate changes are handled correctly because the rate is captured when work is logged.

### Project Management
Project attribution source. Work sessions link to projects, enabling labor cost tracking per building and per job type. Budget hours compared against actual hours.

### Scheduling & Calendar
Shift assignment context. Scheduled shifts provide expected hours for comparison with actual hours worked. Discrepancies between scheduled and actual become visible.

### Safety Compliance
Work eligibility verification. Harness inspection and certification requirements verify before clock-in is allowed. Failed inspections block work sessions from being created.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header
**Stop Dreading Payday**

### Body Copy
Payday shouldn't consume your afternoon. It shouldn't involve a calculator, a pen, and 48 pages of printouts spread across your desk. It definitely shouldn't result in random e-transfers that confuse your bookkeeper and corrections that take longer than the original processing.

Right now, payroll is probably the most hated task on your calendar. You put it off. You run late. Your employees start budgeting around "getting paid late." That culture of lateness bleeds into everything else.

When payroll takes 30 minutes instead of 6 hours, you stop avoiding it. You run on time. Your team notices. The professional standards you set for payroll extend to project timelines, client communications, and safety documentation.

You get back 260+ hours per year. That's six full work weeks. Time currently spent circling numbers that could go toward bidding new contracts, managing client relationships, or simply being present for the work you actually want to do.

## 10. FAQs

**Does OnRopePro calculate my taxes and deductions?**
No. OnRopePro prepares payroll-ready timesheet data for export. Actual payroll calculations (CPP, EI, tax withholding, Social Security, Medicare) happen in your payroll processing software (QuickBooks, ADP, Gusto, etc.). OnRopePro handles time aggregation and export, not tax compliance.

**What pay period options are available?**
Weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly. The system generates period boundaries automatically based on your selection.

**How does overtime calculation work?**
You configure the rules: daily trigger (default 8 hours), weekly trigger (default 40 hours), and multiplier (1.5x, 2x, etc.). The system applies these rules automatically to every work session. You can disable overtime entirely if your pay structure doesn't include it.

**What format does the export use?**
CSV for payroll software import. PDF for printable timesheet records. Both include employee-level detail and project attribution.

**Who can see payroll data?**
Users with the canAccessFinancials permission. This is granted through the role-based permission system. Technicians see their own hours but not compensation rates or other employees' data.

**What happens if a work session is missing or incorrect?**
Supervisors with appropriate permissions can review and adjust work sessions before timesheet approval. All adjustments are logged with reasons for audit purposes.

**Can I see historical pay periods?**
Yes. Previous pay periods remain accessible. Filter by date range to pull data from any past period.

**Does project attribution work if a technician works at multiple buildings in one day?**
Yes. Each work session links to a specific project. If a technician clocks into Building A for 4 hours, then Building B for 4 hours, both sessions show separately with their respective project attribution.

**What about non-billable time like travel between sites?**
Non-billable work sessions track hours that cannot be charged to clients (travel, training, equipment maintenance, weather delays). The payroll view shows both billable and non-billable hours so you know your true labor cost.

**Is there an approval workflow before export?**
Yes. Timesheets can be reviewed and approved before export. Approved timesheets generate clean export files. The workflow prevents exporting data that hasn't been verified.
