## 🎯 The Golden Rule

> **Your PSR is your portable professional safety identity. It belongs to you, follows you everywhere, and proves your commitment to safety with data, not words.**

### The Core Formula

```
PSR = Weighted Average of Component Scores

Solo Technician (Not Linked):
PSR = (Certifications × 33%) + (Safety Documents × 33%) + (Safety Quizzes × 34%)

Employer-Linked Technician:
PSR = (Certifications × 25%) + (Safety Documents × 25%) + (Safety Quizzes × 25%) + (Work History × 25%)
```

**Why This Matters:** PSR creates quantified accountability. Unlike paper resumes or verbal references, PSR proves safety consciousness through verifiable behavior tracked across your entire career. Employers can see your safety track record before hiring. Technicians build career capital through daily diligence.

**Validated Quote (Lines 21-22):**
> "For sure, this PSR 100, people are gonna be like, employees are going to be like, what's your PSR? Mine's 82... people are gonna compete, and it's good because it's going to bring the safety up without them even knowing it."

## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **Important: Safety Compliance**
>
> The Personal Safety Rating helps track and demonstrate safety compliance, but **OnRopePro is not a substitute for professional safety training or certification body requirements.** You remain responsible for:
>
> - Maintaining your official IRATA/SPRAT logbook per certification body requirements
> - Completing all required safety training and assessments
> - Following all applicable OSHA/WorkSafeBC regulations
> - Performing proper equipment inspections regardless of app tracking
>
> **PSR is a professional development tool, not a replacement for certified safety programs.**

**Validated Quote (Lines 182-184, Technician Account Overview):**
> "Obviously you still have to fill in your book. That disclaimer has to be there... It is there in big red letter."

## ✅ Problems Solved (Stakeholder-Segmented)

**The PSR module solves different problems for different stakeholders.** This section is organized by user type to help each stakeholder immediately identify the pain points most relevant to them.

---

## 👔 For Rope Access Company Owners

### Problem 1: "I can't tell if a candidate is actually safety-conscious before hiring"

**The Pain:**
You review resumes and conduct interviews, but there's no objective way to verify a technician's actual safety track record. References are subjective. Certifications prove training, not behavior. You've hired techs who looked great on paper but skipped inspections and cut corners once on the job.

**Real Example:**
Owner hires Level 2 technician with great references. Within the first month, discovers the tech has been skipping harness inspections "because I've done this for years." Now the owner faces liability exposure and must retrain or terminate.

**The Solution:**
PSR provides objective, quantified safety data based on actual behavior. View a candidate's inspection completion rate, quiz scores, and document acknowledgment history before making hiring decisions. Data spans their entire career across all employers.

**The Benefit:**
Make data-driven hiring decisions. Identify safety-conscious technicians before they join your team. Reduce liability exposure from careless hires.

**Validated Quote (Lines 20-21):**
> "A company will want to hire somebody with a high PSR... They're maybe even willing to pay more for a person with a high PSR because it's going to impact their CSR"

---

### Problem 2: "I want to incentivize safety without micromanaging"

**The Pain:**
You know safety matters, but constantly reminding techs to do inspections feels like nagging. You can't be on every site watching everyone. Some techs are diligent; others need constant oversight. You want a system where safety becomes self-motivated.

**Real Example:**
Owner implements bonus structure: "Everyone gets $50 if we have zero incidents this quarter." Result: Techs hide minor incidents to protect the bonus. No behavior change, just hidden problems.

**The Solution:**
PSR creates individual accountability with visible scores. Techs compete naturally. High PSR becomes a point of professional pride. You can tie compensation to PSR thresholds without monitoring every inspection.

**The Benefit:**
Automated accountability. Tie raises to PSR milestones. "Bring your PSR above 75, you get a dollar more per hour." No micromanagement required.

**Validated Quote (Lines 19-21):**
> "You hit a certain PSR, your wage goes up... You could almost auto manage your employees... employees are going to be like, what's your PSR? Mine's 82. That will be a thing for sure."

---

### Problem 3: "New hires might drag down our safety metrics even when they're doing everything right"

**The Pain (Original Concern):**
You've built a company with excellent safety culture. Your CSR is 97%. You hire three experienced techs with good (but not perfect) 85% PSRs. If their scores average into your CSR, your rating drops through no fault of your own.

**The Solution:**
PSR and CSR are calculated separately. The Workforce Safety Score (WSS) shows average employee PSR for your reference, but it does not directly impact your CSR. Your CSR reflects YOUR company's documentation, training, and enforcement systems.

**The Benefit:**
Hire confidently without penalizing your company rating. Use WSS to identify which employees need coaching. CSR stays under your control.

**Validated Quote (Lines 24-25, 48):**
> "Even if I hire three guys that are 90... your score goes down... We are not going to have it directly impact the CSR... But we will have it displayed just for the company owner"

---

### Problem 4: "I don't know which employees need safety coaching"

**The Pain:**
You have 15 technicians across multiple job sites. Some are diligent about safety; others cut corners when unsupervised. Without individual tracking, you treat everyone the same, missing opportunities to coach specific people or recognize top performers.

**Real Example:**
Annual safety review reveals three near-misses all involved the same technician, but there was no early warning system. By the time patterns emerge, bad habits are entrenched.

**The Solution:**
Workforce Safety Score (WSS) displays average PSR of all linked employees. Drill down to see individual PSR scores. Identify low performers early. Recognize and reward high performers.

**The Benefit:**
Targeted coaching instead of blanket policies. Early intervention before incidents occur. Data for performance reviews and compensation decisions.

---

## 📋 For Operations Managers & Supervisors

### Problem 1: "I can't verify my crew completed safety requirements before I arrive on site"

**The Pain:**
You're responsible for crew safety but can't be everywhere at once. You assign a crew to a site, expecting them to complete harness inspections before starting work. But did they? You won't know until you physically check, and by then work may have already started.

**Real Example:**
Supervisor arrives at site at 10am to find crew started at 8am without completing inspections. Now you have a compliance gap and no documentation. Crew says "we checked everything, just didn't log it."

**The Solution:**
PSR component for safety documents tracks harness inspection completion in real-time. System enforces inspection before work sessions can begin. You can verify crew compliance remotely through the dashboard.

**The Benefit:**
Remote compliance verification. Hard enforcement prevents workarounds. Audit trail proves due diligence.

---

### Problem 2: "Performance reviews are subjective without safety data"

**The Pain:**
You're asked to evaluate technicians for raises or promotions. You know who's a "good worker" based on gut feeling, but you can't quantify safety performance. Two techs both have zero incidents, but one consistently completes all safety protocols while the other cuts corners.

**The Solution:**
PSR provides objective safety data for each technician. Compare scores across your crew. Use historical trends to identify improvement or decline. Support performance decisions with data.

**The Benefit:**
Objective performance data. Fair evaluations based on behavior. Documentation for HR decisions.

---

## 👷 For Rope Access Technicians

### Problem 1: "I've been safe for years but have nothing to prove it"

**The Pain:**
You've completed thousands of inspections, never had an incident, always sign documents promptly. But when you apply for a new job, you're starting from zero. Your reputation doesn't transfer. You have to prove yourself again at every company.

**Real Example:**
Tech with 8 years experience and spotless record applies to new company. Competing against fresh Level 2 who just got certified. No way to demonstrate the difference in professionalism.

**The Solution:**
PSR aggregates your safety activities across ALL employers over your entire career. Every inspection, quiz, and document acknowledgment builds your permanent professional safety record. It follows you when you change jobs.

**The Benefit:**
Quantified proof of your professionalism. Competitive advantage when seeking work. Your reputation is portable.

**Validated Quote (Lines 8-9):**
> "If they do a harness inspection while they're working for a company, it counts towards their PSR. Even though if they change company, it stays with them."

---

### Problem 2: "Safety is just paperwork nobody cares about"

**The Pain:**
You do your inspections because you're supposed to. But it feels like checking boxes. Nobody reviews them. Your diligence isn't recognized or rewarded. Meanwhile, techs who cut corners get the same treatment.

**The Solution:**
PSR makes your safety behavior visible and valuable. Employers can see your score before hiring. High PSR techs command respect and potentially higher pay. Your daily diligence accumulates into career capital.

**The Benefit:**
Your safety consciousness becomes a measurable asset. "What's your PSR?" becomes a professional benchmark. Pride in your score motivates continued excellence.

**Validated Quote (Lines 21-22):**
> "For sure, this PSR 100, people are gonna be like, employees are going to be like, what's your PSR? Mine's 82... people are gonna compete, and it's good because it's going to bring the safety up without them even knowing it."

---

### Problem 3: "I don't know what I need to do to maximize my score"

**The Pain:**
You see your PSR percentage but don't understand what factors into it or how to improve. Documentation says "complete quizzes" but you don't know how many or which ones matter for your level.

**The Solution:**
PSR breaks down into clear components: certifications, safety documents, quizzes, and work history (when employer-linked). Each component shows your current score. Quiz availability is dynamic based on your certification level and employer connection.

**The Benefit:**
Clear path to improvement. Know exactly what counts toward your score. No guessing about requirements.

**Validated Quote (Lines 9-10):**
> "There's safety quizzes that are always there. The IRATA or SPRAT depending on their score. And then there are the safety quizzes about the company's documents."

---

### Problem 4: "My hard work doesn't transfer when I change jobs"

**The Pain:**
You spent two years building a perfect safety record at Company A. You change jobs for better pay. At Company B, you start with no track record. All that diligence, all those inspections, all those quizzes, gone.

**The Solution:**
PSR is tied to YOUR technician account, not your employer. When you link to a new company, your entire safety history comes with you. The new employer sees your 95% PSR on day one.

**The Benefit:**
Career continuity. Your professional reputation travels with you. Switching jobs doesn't reset your standing.

**Validated Quote (Lines 8-9):**
> "Their PSR is not linked to the company they're working for. It's over time... Even though if they change company, it stays with them."

---

## 🏢 For Property Managers

### Problem 1: "I can't verify if vendors actually enforce safety standards with their teams"

**The Pain:**
You require vendors to have safety programs. They send you manuals and certificates. But you have no visibility into whether their techs actually follow procedures daily. You're trusting paperwork, not behavior.

**The Solution:**
CSR shows company-level compliance. Additionally, you can ask about Workforce Safety Score (WSS), the average PSR of their team. A company with 95% CSR but 65% average PSR has documentation but not culture.

**The Benefit:**
Deeper due diligence capability. Distinguish between "has safety manual" and "practices safety daily."

## 📊 PSR Calculation Deep Dive

### Component Weighting

| Component | Solo Tech (Not Linked) | Employer-Linked Tech |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Certifications** | 33% | 25% |
| **Safety Documents** | 33% | 25% |
| **Safety Quizzes** | 34% | 25% |
| **Work History** | N/A | 25% |

**Validated Quote (Line 11):**
> "When not linked to an employer, each section is weighted at 33%... [When linked] each are weighted 25%"

---

### Component 1: Certifications

**What It Measures:** Your IRATA/SPRAT certification status and verification level.

**Scoring:**

| Status | Score | Explanation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Valid & Verified | 100% | Active certification confirmed by OnRopePro verification |
| Valid but Unverified | 75% | Active certification not yet verified through system |
| No expiration date set | 50% | Certificate uploaded but missing expiration |
| Expired | 25% | Certification past expiration date |
| No certification | 0% | No IRATA/SPRAT certification on record |

**Key Note:** Having a valid, verified certification does NOT automatically give you 100% PSR. You must also complete quizzes to maximize this component.

**Validated Quote (Lines 10-11):**
> "So this says certifications valid verified IRATA/SPRAT certification scores highest. 100%. Does that mean that's the highest section? Okay. Okay. Okay, gotcha. So each section is weighted 33% when they're connected to an employer."

---

### Component 2: Safety Documents (Harness Inspections)

**What It Measures:** Your harness inspection completion rate over time.

**Formula:**
```
Safety Documents Score = (Passed Inspections / Total Inspections) × 100
```

**Critical Clarification:** This is calculated OVER TIME across ALL employers, not just the past 30 days.

**Validated Quote (Lines 8-9):**
> "It's not in the past 30 days. It's over time... If they do a harness inspection while they're working for a company, it counts towards their PSR. Even though if they change company, it stays with them."

**Key Characteristics:**
- Aggregated across all employers over your career
- Portable when you change companies
- Does not reset when you leave an employer
- Counts all inspections (passed and failed)

---

### Component 3: Safety Quizzes

**What It Measures:** Your completion of available safety knowledge quizzes.

**Formula:**
```
Safety Quizzes Score = (Quizzes Passed / Available Quizzes) × 100
```

**Quiz Availability (Dynamic):**

| Situation | Available Quizzes |
|-----------|-------------------|
| IRATA/SPRAT Level 1 only | 2 quizzes |
| IRATA Level 2 | 4 quizzes |
| IRATA Level 3 | 6 quizzes |
| Both IRATA & SPRAT Level 1 | 4 quizzes |
| Connected to employer | + Company document quizzes |

**Validated Quote (Lines 9-10):**
> "I removed the 6 because it could be more depending on what document the company uploads and what level you are... There's safety quizzes that are always there. The IRATA or SPRAT depending on their score. And then there are the safety quizzes about the company's documents."

**Company Document Quizzes (When Employer-Linked):**
- Health & Safety Manual quiz
- Company Policy quiz
- Safe Work Procedures quizzes (one per uploaded procedure)
- Safe Work Practices quizzes (one per uploaded practice)

**Key Note:** If not connected to a company, only certification-based quizzes are available.

**Validated Quote (Line 10):**
> "So if I'm not connected to a company, there are no quizzes there. There's only the quizzes according to their certification."

---

### Component 4: Work History (Employer-Linked Only)

**What It Measures:** Your incident record while linked to an employer.

**Formula:**
```
Work History Score = 100% - (10% × Number of Incidents)
Minimum Score: 50%
```

**Scoring Logic:**
- Starts at 100%
- Minus 10% per recorded incident
- Cannot drop below 50%
- New workers with no sessions start at 50%

**When It Applies:** Only calculated when linked to an employer. Solo technicians have three components weighted at 33% each.

---

## 🔄 PSR vs CSR Relationship

### Key Distinction

| Metric | PSR (Personal Safety Rating) | CSR (Company Safety Rating) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Belongs to** | Individual technician | Company |
| **Portability** | Follows you between employers | Stays with company |
| **Visibility** | Employers see during hiring | Property managers see during vendor selection |
| **Components** | Personal inspections, quizzes, incidents | Company docs, toolbox meetings, team compliance |

### Independence Principle

PSR and CSR are calculated separately. They do not directly impact each other.

**Validated Quote (Lines 48):**
> "We are not going to have it directly impact the CSR. No. But we will have it displayed just for the company owner... the WSS."

### Indirect Relationship

While PSR does not directly feed into CSR, completing personal safety tasks improves both metrics:
- Harness inspections improve your PSR AND contribute to company's inspection compliance (CSR)
- Document signatures improve your PSR AND contribute to company's document review score (CSR)
- Your daily safety behavior benefits both your personal rating and your employer's rating

---

## 📈 Workforce Safety Score (WSS)

### What It Is

The Workforce Safety Score displays the average PSR of all employees linked to a company.

**Formula:**
```
WSS = Sum of All Employee PSRs / Number of Employees
```

### Who Sees It

| Role | WSS Visibility |
|------|----------------|
| Company Owner | ✅ Full visibility |
| Operations Manager | ✅ Full visibility |
| Supervisor | ⚪ Own crew only |
| Technician | ❌ No access |
| Property Manager | ❌ No access |

### Purpose

WSS is an **informational metric only**. It helps owners:
- Evaluate candidates during hiring (compare PSR to team average)
- Identify employees who need safety coaching
- Track team safety culture over time
- Make data-driven decisions about training investments

### Important: WSS Does NOT Impact CSR

**Validated Quote (Lines 24-25, 48):**
> "Maybe it should be two separate things, like the workforce. It would not impact anything. It would just be there as a reference for the company owner... We are not going to have it directly impact the CSR."

**Reasoning:** A company with excellent systems (high CSR) shouldn't be penalized for hiring technicians with lower PSRs. The company's rating reflects their policies and enforcement, not the historical behavior of people they just hired.

- ❌ Let certification expire (drops score immediately)
- ❌ Assume PSR doesn't matter (employers increasingly check it)

---

### For Company Owners

**Do:**
- ✅ Check WSS weekly to monitor team safety culture
- ✅ Discuss PSR during hiring conversations
- ✅ Create PSR-based incentives to motivate improvement
- ✅ Use low individual PSRs as coaching opportunities, not punishment
- ✅ Recognize and reward high PSR performers

**Don't:**
- ❌ Ignore WSS data (it reveals team culture)
- ❌ Hire based on PSR alone (it's one factor among many)
- ❌ Expect new hires to immediately have high PSRs
- ❌ Punish employees for low PSR without providing improvement path

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why is my quiz count different from my coworker's?"

**Answer:** Quiz availability depends on your certification level and employer connection. A Level 2 tech sees more quizzes than Level 1. When connected to an employer, you also see quizzes for company documents.

**Validated Quote (Lines 9-10):**
> "There's safety quizzes that are always there. The IRATA or SPRAT depending on their score. And then there are the safety quizzes about the company's documents."

---

### "Does my PSR affect my employer's CSR?"

**Answer:** No, PSR and CSR are calculated separately. Your PSR does not directly impact your employer's CSR. However, completing safety tasks (inspections, document signatures) improves both your PSR and contributes to company metrics.

**Validated Quote (Line 48):**
> "We are not going to have it directly impact the CSR."

---

### "What happens to my PSR when I change jobs?"

**Answer:** Your PSR follows you. All inspections, quizzes, and safety history from previous employers remain part of your permanent record. Your new employer sees your complete PSR on day one.

**Validated Quote (Lines 8-9):**
> "If they do a harness inspection while they're working for a company, it counts towards their PSR. Even though if they change company, it stays with them."

---

### "How quickly does my PSR update?"

**Answer:** PSR updates in real-time as you complete safety activities. Complete an inspection and your score recalculates immediately. No waiting period or manual updates required.

---

### "Can I see what's hurting my PSR?"

**Answer:** Yes. Your PSR breaks down into component scores. You can see exactly which component (certifications, safety documents, quizzes, work history) is lower and focus improvement there.

---

### "Why did my score drop after changing employers?"

**Answer:** When you link to a new employer, the Work History component activates (25% weight). If you're new to that employer with no sessions, Work History starts at 50%. This is temporary and improves as you complete sessions without incidents.

---

### "What's the difference between PSR and CSR?"

**Answer:** PSR (Personal Safety Rating) belongs to you as an individual technician. CSR (Company Safety Rating) belongs to the company. PSR tracks your personal safety behavior; CSR tracks company-wide compliance systems.
