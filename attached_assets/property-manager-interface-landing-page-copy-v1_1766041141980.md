## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** Problem-aware property managers managing 10-70+ buildings with multiple rope access vendors  
**Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware (know they lack visibility, not yet solution-aware)  
**Primary Psychological Frameworks:**
- Loss Aversion (liability exposure without documented due diligence)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one dashboard replaces scattered information)
- Risk Mitigation (insurance and compliance documentation)

**Emotional Territory:** Security, Control, Relief  
**Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

### Alternative Headlines
1. When Insurance Asks About Vendor Due Diligence, What Will You Show Them?
2. Stop Choosing Rope Access Vendors by Price Alone
3. See Every Vendor's Safety Score Before You Sign the Contract

### Subheadline
Compare vendor safety ratings, track complaint response times, and document your due diligence. All in one read-only dashboard designed specifically for property managers.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**The Liability Gap Nobody Mentions**

### Body Copy

You hire rope access companies to clean windows, maintain facades, and service buildings 20 stories up. But when the insurance adjuster asks what due diligence you performed on your contractor's safety practices, what do you show them?

Most property managers have nothing. You picked the vendor based on price, maybe a reference call, and hope they know what they're doing. Their safety record? A mystery. Their complaint response rate? Unknown. Whether they've kept up with equipment inspections? Complete blind spot.

Then something goes wrong.

OnRopePro gives property managers direct visibility into vendor safety compliance without the administrative burden. See Company Safety Ratings. Track complaint resolution times. Compare vendors with objective data before you sign. When someone asks "Did you verify this contractor?" you have documented proof.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header
**What This Module Does**

### Subheadline
Vendor transparency without vendor access

### Intro Copy
The Property Manager Interface provides read-only visibility into your rope access vendors' safety compliance and responsiveness. You see what matters. You control nothing that isn't yours.

---

### Card 1: My Vendors Dashboard

Your central hub for every rope access company servicing your buildings. No more digging through contracts or emails to find who services what property.

**What you see at a glance:**
- All contracted rope access companies
- CSR (Company Safety Rating) scores per vendor
- Quick access to building-level details
- Search and filter by vendor or property

---

### Card 2: Company Safety Rating Visibility

Three compliance percentages tell you how seriously each vendor takes safety: documentation completeness, toolbox meeting frequency, and harness inspection rates. You see the score, not the underlying documents.

**What the rating reveals:**
- Documentation compliance percentage
- Toolbox meeting completion rate
- Harness inspection frequency
- Historical trend direction (improving or declining)

---

### Card 3: Response Time and Feedback Tracking

When residents complain about streaky windows or missed spots, does your vendor actually respond? Average resolution time and feedback history show you which vendors address issues and which ones ignore them.

**What you track:**
- Average complaint resolution time
- Feedback history per building
- Response rate by vendor
- Issue patterns over time

---

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Property Managers

**Documented due diligence when it matters most.** When insurance adjusters or legal teams ask about your vendor vetting process, you have timestamped CSR scores and compliance data on record. Not a folder full of promises. Actual data.

**Instant vendor comparison beyond price.** Two vendors bid within $200 of each other. One has an 86% CSR score. The other sits at 23%. Now you have something real to base your decision on besides lowest number wins.

**One dashboard for your entire portfolio.** Fifty buildings. Six vendors. Instead of searching emails and contracts, you check one screen. Which company services that building on Main Street? Thirty seconds. Done.

---

### For Rope Access Company Owners (Primary Buyers)

**Stop manually generating safety reports for property managers.** They ask quarterly. They lose the files. They ask again. With the Property Manager Interface, clients check your CSR score whenever they want. No PDFs. No PowerPoints. No repeated email threads.

**Win contracts on safety, not just price.** Your 94% CSR score becomes a visible competitive advantage. Property managers comparing vendors see exactly where you stand before signing. Good safety practices finally pay off in contract decisions.

**Control what property managers see.** Read-only access protects your operational data. They see compliance percentages, not individual documents. They view project progress, not employee information. Transparency without exposure.

---

### For Building Managers

**Confidence in the contractors on your property.** Rope access work happens 200 feet above your tenants. CSR scores show you the safety compliance record of every contractor accessing your building. Not just their marketing claims.

**Clear accountability for vendor performance.** Track feedback history and response times for your specific building. When complaints pile up without resolution, you have data to support the conversation.

---

### For Technicians

**Your company's professionalism speaks for itself.** When property managers see your employer's high CSR score, it reflects the safety practices you maintain every day. Good work becomes visible to the people approving contracts.

---

### For Residents

**Transparency about who services your building.** Through the connected Resident Portal, tenants can see that their building contracts with safety-compliant vendors. The rope access company working on your home isn't a mystery.

---

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy
Six capabilities that transform how property managers evaluate and monitor rope access vendors.

---

### Feature 1: CSR Score Display
View the Company Safety Rating for every contracted vendor. Three compliance percentages (documentation, toolbox meetings, harness inspections) combine into one clear picture of safety practices. Compare vendors instantly without requesting a single document.

### Feature 2: Anchor Inspection Certificate Upload
Your one write permission. Upload annual anchor inspection certificates directly to each building's record. Building owners often receive these from third-party inspectors, not vendors. Now they attach properly without handing documents to contractors.

### Feature 3: Property Manager Code Access
One code from each vendor grants access. Create your account, enter the buildings you manage, and you're connected. The vendor sees who has linked. You see only your properties.

### Feature 4: Response Time Metrics
How long does your vendor take to address complaints? Average resolution time surfaces vendors who respond quickly and exposes those who don't. Response time may matter more to you than safety scores. Now you see both.

### Feature 5: Building-Level Feedback History
Every complaint and resolution for your buildings, visible in one place. Track patterns. Identify recurring issues. Document vendor performance over months and years, not just recent memory.

### Feature 6: Read-Only Data Protection
You see compliance percentages, not underlying documents. You view project progress, not employee personal details. You check feedback history, not financial data. The right visibility with the right boundaries.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Property Managers

**"I need to know if my vendors are actually following safety protocols."**

You hire a rope access company based on lowest bid. Six months later, a technician has an incident. Insurance asks what due diligence you performed on this vendor's safety record. You have nothing. A phone reference from three years ago. Maybe a brochure.

CSR scores show three compliance percentages updated automatically. Documentation completeness. Toolbox meeting frequency. Harness inspection rates. You see exactly where each vendor stands on safety, documented and timestamped.

---

**"I manage 60 buildings with different vendors. Finding who services what takes forever."**

A resident complaint comes in about rope access work at the building on Oak Street. Which company services that property? You search emails. Check contracts. Maybe call the building manager. Twenty minutes later, you have an answer.

My Vendors Dashboard centralizes every contracted company. Click on a building. See the vendor. Access their CSR score and contact information. Thirty seconds replaces thirty minutes.

---

**"Vendors don't respond to complaints and I have no way to prove it."**

Residents report streaky windows. You forward the complaint. Nothing happens. They report again. You forward again. Did the vendor respond? Did they fix it? Did they even acknowledge the issue?

Feedback history per building tracks every complaint and resolution. Average response time reveals how long issues actually take to address. When vendor performance conversations happen, you have data, not assumptions.

---

### For Rope Access Company Owners

**"Property managers keep asking for safety documentation and I waste hours responding."**

Three property managers request proof of current safety compliance in the same week. Your admin pulls documents, formats reports, emails everything out. Next quarter, they ask again. The same documents. The same process.

CSR scores update automatically. Property managers check compliance status whenever they want. Self-serve transparency eliminates the request cycle entirely.

---

**"I want to show my safety record without giving clients access to our operational systems."**

You invest heavily in safety compliance. Equipment inspections. Training documentation. Toolbox meetings. But proving it to property managers means either manual reports or inappropriate system access.

The Property Manager Interface shows CSR percentages without exposing operational data. They see your professionalism. They don't see your payroll, employee details, or internal documents. Transparency with boundaries.

---

### For Building Managers

**"I have no visibility into contractor safety practices for my property."**

Rope access technicians rappel down your building exterior every month. Their employer claims excellent safety practices. But you have no verification beyond their word. Until something goes wrong.

CSR scores provide independent visibility into contractor compliance. Documentation, toolbox meetings, equipment inspections. Objective data you can verify before an incident, not after.

---

## 7. Measurable Results

### Time Savings
**98% reduction in vendor safety lookup time.** From 20-30 minutes searching emails and contracts to 30 seconds in the My Vendors Dashboard. For property managers handling 50+ buildings, this saves hours monthly.

### Decision Quality
**3x more data points for vendor comparison.** Price alone used to determine vendor selection. Now you compare price, CSR score, and response time. Objective data replaces gut feel and hope.

### Liability Protection
**Documented due diligence at all times.** CSR scores create timestamped records of vendor safety compliance visibility. When insurance or legal questions arise, you have proof of ongoing monitoring, not just initial vetting.

### Administrative Elimination
**100% reduction in compliance report requests.** Property managers access CSR scores directly. No more quarterly email threads requesting safety documentation. Self-serve transparency replaces manual reporting.

## 8. Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy
The Property Manager Interface connects to five other OnRopePro modules, pulling data to create a complete vendor visibility picture.

---

### Company Safety Rating (CSR)
CSR scores displayed in the Property Manager Interface come directly from the CSR module. As vendors update safety documentation, complete toolbox meetings, and log harness inspections, property managers see those percentages change in real time.

### Project Management
View active and completed projects per building. Property managers see project progress without accessing internal scheduling or resource allocation. Timeline visibility without operational exposure.

### Document Management
Anchor inspection certificates uploaded by property managers store through the Document Management system. The one write permission connects to centralized document storage per building.

### Resident Portal
Property Manager Interface and Resident Portal share the same access code architecture. Both provide external stakeholder visibility with appropriate permission boundaries.

### Feedback System
Complaint history and response time metrics pull from the Feedback module. Resident-submitted feedback becomes visible to property managers, creating accountability across the vendor relationship.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header
**Stop Managing Blind. Start Managing Informed.**

### Body Copy

Right now, you choose rope access vendors based on price and hope. You forward complaints and wonder if they're addressed. You carry liability for contractors whose safety practices you've never actually verified.

When insurance asks about due diligence, you show them nothing because you have nothing to show.

The Property Manager Interface changes this equation. Log in and see every vendor's CSR score. Compare safety compliance before signing contracts. Track complaint resolution over time. Upload anchor inspection certificates to the right building record.

You get visibility without administrative burden. Transparency without inappropriate access. Documented proof that you monitor your vendors, not just hire them.

And when someone asks what due diligence you performed? You show them exactly what you saw.

---

## 10. FAQs

**What can property managers actually edit in the system?**
One thing: anchor inspection certificates. You can upload annual anchor inspection certificates to each building you manage. Everything else is read-only. No risk of accidentally modifying operational records.

**Can I see individual safety documents from my vendors?**
No. You see CSR percentages indicating compliance levels, not the underlying documents. This provides transparency without exposing operational details.

**How do I get access to the Property Manager Interface?**
Your rope access vendor provides a Property Manager Code. Use that code to create your account, then specify which buildings you manage. Access is granted at the building level.

**Can different property managers at my company see different buildings?**
Yes. Each property manager creates their own account and specifies which buildings they manage. You only see vendors and data relevant to your portfolio.

**What if I manage buildings serviced by multiple rope access companies?**
My Vendors Dashboard shows all contracted companies across your portfolio. You see every vendor relationship in one view, regardless of how many companies service your buildings.

**Can my vendors see that I've viewed their information?**
Vendors know which property managers have connected via their code. They cannot see when you log in or what specific information you view.

**How often are CSR scores updated?**
CSR scores update automatically as vendors log safety activities. You always see current compliance status, not quarterly snapshots.

**What's the difference between CSR score and response time? Which matters more?**
CSR measures safety compliance (documentation, toolbox meetings, harness inspections). Response time measures how quickly vendors address complaints. Many property managers care more about response time. You see both metrics.

**Can I upload documents other than anchor inspection certificates?**
No. The single write permission is specifically for annual anchor inspection certificates. This maintains data integrity while acknowledging that building owners often receive these third-party certificates directly.

**Is my data separated from other property managers at my company?**
Yes. Each property manager account sees only the buildings they specified during setup. Portfolio separation is built into the access model.

## A/B Test Recommendations

**Test 1: Headline angle**
- Control: "Your Vendors Have Safety Records. You Just Can't See Them."
- Variant: "When Insurance Asks About Vendor Due Diligence, What Will You Show Them?"
- Why: Tests problem-aware headline vs. consequence-focused headline

**Test 2: Primary benefit emphasis**
- Control: Lead with CSR visibility
- Variant: Lead with response time tracking
- Why: SSOT notes response time may matter more to property managers than CSR
