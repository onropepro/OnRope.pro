# OnRopePro - Modules - User Access & Authentication / Resident Feedback

**Meeting Date:** 4th Dec, 2025 - 12:09 PM

---

**Speaker 1** *[00:03]*: I will go into user access. So you're in user access right now? 
**Speaker 2** *[00:07]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:07]*: You're in super. Super user. You're in change log or. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:11]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:12]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:14]*: In the guide. Okay. So if you go down to employee. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:21]*: Role, you're in the authentication and user. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:24]*: Management. User access and identification guide. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:29]*: Yeah. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:32]*: Go down to employee role hierarchy. I can't say that. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:36]*: One hierarchy. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:37]*: Yeah, I would get rid of that completely because there. There are a lot of permissions. And in one company, operations manager could have access to financials and another company, he could not. Could just be in charge of employees. Where a ground crew could have access to. Quoting. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:02]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:03]*: Like you can give any permission to any employee. Like, you guys could not be a. Supervision yet. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:09]*: So permissions are granted by. By the company owner. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:15]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:16]*: Okay. So are the. Are the operations manager, supervisor, rope access technician, and ground crew. Are those login. Are those user accounts or what are those? 
**Speaker 2** *[01:28]*: So the company owner creates those account. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:32]*: Okay. And they call them. Because I see operations underscore, manager. Like, is that some. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:39]*: If I don't know what. What. This is the underscore. So when you created a new employee. So you're going to create new employee. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:46]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:46]*: Name, temporary password, a bunch of details and then you pick what they are. So there's a. There's a grid of a bunch of position. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:55]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:56]*: Like. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:56]*: And that's where it's getting this information from. Is that grid from the. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:59]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:00]*: Positions. 
**Speaker 2** *[02:00]*: Probably. But there's. There's a lot more. There's like hr, there's like rollbacks a step ground crew. There's like supervisor, operations manager, but I added a bunch. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:13]*: There's a whole bunch of ones. And there's customers. 
**Speaker 2** *[02:18]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:18]*: If there's not, it doesn't matter. 
**Speaker 2** *[02:20]*: Yeah, there's. They're all there. Like pretty much from robots. That too. And then from there go next. And that's where all the permissions are. They're per categories. So financial permission. Okay. I want him to be at. Have access to quote CD numbers for inventory. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:40]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[02:41]*: Okay. And then like inventory, there's those permissions and then there's. Complaint management. Create projects. All these are like all permissions. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:53]*: Okay. So the. So. The. Hierarchy is not the way that it should be. Right now it is. So there's a company owner. 
**Speaker 2** *[03:11]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:12]*: And then that company owner can select from a whole variety of different. 
**Speaker 2** *[03:18]*: Yes, I suck. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:23]*: A whole bunch of different roles. And there are. 
**Speaker 2** *[03:28]*: It's like from laborer to owner. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:30]*: Right. So we've got owner, operations matter, human resources, accounting, account manager, general Supervisor, rope access. Supervisor. Manager, rope access. Ticker Technician, ground crew. Supervisor, ground crew, labor. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[03:46]*: And no admin. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:49]*: Oh, well, there's human resources. 
**Speaker 2** *[03:51]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:58]*: So there may. We might want to like that person that Jeff is talking about hiring the. 
**Speaker 2** *[04:03]*: Administrator type of thing. What would they be? Yeah. I don't know what they would be. It could be like operations manager. They could be general supervisor. They could be account manager. Yeah, there. Other. I guess I could add an other. Like a custom. Right. 
**Speaker 1** *[04:32]*: Yeah, like. 
**Speaker 2** *[04:33]*: Thank you. Because there could be like in a massive company, inventory manager. 
**Speaker 1** *[04:40]*: Yeah, right. Yeah. So, yeah, there's. Yeah, I guess custom option. 
**Speaker 2** *[04:51]*: And then. So, yeah, he's just. 
**Speaker 1** *[04:56]*: So the important thing is that there's a base role and then there's granular permissions that you can assign to that base role. 
**Speaker 2** *[05:06]*: Yeah, that's what. So once you fill everything here, blah, blah. I don't think I need to fill. Then you click. What permission you want to grant. 
**Speaker 1** *[05:19]*: Okay. Yeah, so those are all granular. Permissions. Okay. Easy peasy. And then under that there's external user roles. So you've got resident. 
**Speaker 2** *[05:41]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[05:42]*: You've got property manager. 
**Speaker 2** *[05:44]*: And then would employee be. 
**Speaker 1** *[05:50]*: That's an internal. 
**Speaker 2** *[05:51]*: Okay, so external, you have resident, property manager. 
**Speaker 1** *[05:55]*: And were gonna. Did we decide this morning that were gonna do building manager? 
**Speaker 2** *[05:59]*: I don't know. We haven't decided on anything. I don't know if we. 
**Speaker 1** *[06:04]*: So you said something about being up. Able to upload the. 
**Speaker 2** *[06:10]*: Yeah, that's right. Okay. Yeah, so I'll make it. But I think that person will log with the building. So building will have accounts. 
**Speaker 1** *[06:24]*: Right. So an external user role is a building. And that's logged in through the building manager. 
**Speaker 2** *[06:33]*: Yes. So the building managers, building have accounts. Right. Building manager don't. Because building manager do change. 
**Speaker 1** *[06:43]*: Yeah, frequently. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[06:46]*: So now that would be a read only, right? 
**Speaker 1** *[06:50]*: I, I. Well, I mean, if they're uploading. 
**Speaker 2** *[06:53]*: Yeah. So how now, how do you. How do you refuse access to a building manager that left the building? Who does that? 
**Speaker 1** *[07:05]*: Is there a password? You just change the. Would be. 
**Speaker 2** *[07:09]*: But who does that? 
**Speaker 1** *[07:12]*: Probably the property manager. 
**Speaker 2** *[07:13]*: Then. Then you put them in charge of. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:17]*: Mmm, yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[07:19]*: Of account managing. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:23]*: Mm. 
**Speaker 2** *[07:30]*: I guess if. Okay, so if the building manager goes, another one comes. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:35]*: Mm. Well, how does it work for a resident of a suite? 
**Speaker 2** *[07:42]*: Well, again, a new resident would move in. So if a new resident creates an account for that unit, then the past one loses it. Automatically. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:58]*: What if they do it up? What if they. What if they create an account accidentally for the Wrong unit. 
**Speaker 2** *[08:08]*: Like, like how? 
**Speaker 1** *[08:09]*: Like I'm in unit 207 and I accidentally put unit 307. 
**Speaker 2** *[08:21]*: Could be confirm. Like, like a password. Confirm your unit number, enter it twice. If you enter the wrong one twice. 
**Speaker 1** *[08:31]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[08:33]*: Then you should not be able to use any app ever. 
**Speaker 1** *[08:39]*: Right? 
**Speaker 2** *[08:41]*: Yeah. You can enter that unit twice and make like a little warning. I mean, yeah, people could go and create. 
**Speaker 1** *[08:53]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[08:54]*: What if they. 
**Speaker 1** *[08:55]*: What if they want to. What if they have a neighbor they don't like? 
**Speaker 2** *[08:59]*: I mean, like, what are the chances? 
**Speaker 1** *[09:01]*: Yeah. Probably pretty slack. 
**Speaker 2** *[09:03]*: I could create a Hotmail account, glenn@brewbaker.mail.com and send email to a bunch of people. 
**Speaker 1** *[09:11]*: But that doesn't. But that doesn't. 
**Speaker 2** *[09:13]*: But there's nothing you can do. 
**Speaker 1** *[09:15]*: But it doesn't. That doesn't. In that situation, it doesn't. Disable my Hotmail account. 
**Speaker 2** *[09:23]*: No. Okay, so. But you're asking me, what if someone creates. Oh, I see. So if like let's say 307 does have an account and then someone goes and by mistake creates a 307 account, then the actual 307 is out. 
**Speaker 1** *[09:41]*: Is gonzo. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[09:48]*: There would just have to be a warning. Yeah. Not everybody is very smart. 
**Speaker 1** *[10:05]*: Okay, well, let's. We can figure that out. This actually. This guide is actually not part of our. 
**Speaker 2** *[10:13]*: Oh, go ahead. When they create. 307 account by mistake, the app would be like, there's already an Account associated with unit 307. Would you like to replace. Did you just move in or did like something like that? Be like. 
**Speaker 1** *[10:34]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[10:35]*: Oh, I wanted to put two or seven. No, my mistake. And enter the right unit number. So if there is an account already. Yeah, unit 307. There's a pop up window and be like, hey, there's already account associated with that unit. Are you sure that's the right unit number? And then two options. Yes, I'm a new resident or go back. Right. 
**Speaker 1** *[11:01]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[11:02]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[11:07]*: So for the building manager, if they leave and they need a new account. The I, I think the property manager. Would need to have some sort of. Would need to like be able to reset their password or just click a. Like. It is the. 
**Speaker 2** *[11:40]*: I really don't like the idea of the property manager. 
**Speaker 1** *[11:43]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[11:45]*: They're really busy. And now add a task. If they have to manage anything in this app, first they might not do it because they're busy, they forgot. And now they're getting the email back and forth. Hey, it doesn't work. Did you do that? I didn't get this app to add work to my load. The way it could work though. Would be. Since I'm the building manager and I use this thing. And then. I get fired because I'm an asshole. Then a new manager comes in. And. How does he restrict access to the old? A code to build. Every building would have a code. 
**Speaker 1** *[12:56]*: Every building has a code. 
**Speaker 2** *[12:58]*: When the new building manager comes in, change code. So you have to enter the building and the building code. New building manager changes the code. Now they can't go in. So password, I guess. Password. They could change the password. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:18]*: New building manager would just change the password. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:21]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:24]*: Yeah, yeah. So that simple. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:27]*: Yeah. I don't know why. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:31]*: They would just need the old password to be able to get into the account. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:35]*: Yes. Which the pissed off building manager could change. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:40]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:42]*: And now it would just be like they need to contact us on Road Pro. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:48]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:53]*: I mean, like, what are the chances of this happening? 
**Speaker 1** *[13:58]*: Yeah, I mean it'll. 
**Speaker 2** *[13:59]*: App billing manager. That takes time to go in the app and change a password. And then if it happens twice in the next 10 years. Yeah, we'll deal with it. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:08]*: Yeah. So external user roles will have residence, property managers and building managers. 
**Speaker 2** *[14:18]*: No, building. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:20]*: Building. Yeah, yeah. So the. The role is building. The person that is logging in is building manager. 
**Speaker 2** *[14:27]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:28]*: Yeah. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[14:32]*: Building will have accounts. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:33]*: Buildings will have accounts. Okay, so. 
**Speaker 2** *[14:43]*: We. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:47]*: So what problems. So do you want to go to? The problem solved. Yeah, let's talk about the. Let's talk about all the. The features, benefits. Problem solved. 
**Speaker 2** *[15:03]*: Of each account. Of. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:04]*: Yeah, of the accounts, the system as a whole. Like. From each perspective. What. What does this solve? 
**Speaker 2** *[15:14]*: From each account. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:16]*: From each account perspective. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[15:19]*: Okay. So. From the resident. We both know what it is. It's. You can submit complaint. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:27]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[15:28]*: Then get a ton of work off. Property manager. Property manager. Going to love this idea. Right. Less complain about dirty window. These guys are. It's insane. It's probably the most busy job. In there. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:48]*: It's right. 
**Speaker 2** *[15:49]*: They. They'll spend days in front of the computer just for email. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:54]*: So the benefit of this is that it dovetails in with complaint management. And complaint management is kind of the core. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:04]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:04]*: One of the core problems. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:06]*: Forestrada. For a property manager, they get. Imagine a 500 unit building. The neighbor upstairs watered his plant and it went on my balcony. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:20]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:21]*: The neighbor next to me is smoking on his balcony. There's dog in the common area on the third floor. That's this all day. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:32]*: And it happens every Tuesday. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:34]*: Yes. It's. It's like. Yeah, it's this. They deal with all day long and yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:41]*: So the complaints. Those are all complaints that are outside of this system. But the complaints inside the system are like they have. Because complaints happen so often with everything. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:56]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:56]*: It's a total pain in the ass for the property manager. It's a total pain in the ass for the building maintenance company. 
**Speaker 2** *[17:04]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:05]*: Because they're all over the place. 
**Speaker 2** *[17:07]*: Yeah. Because people have so many ways to put complaints in. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:13]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[17:15]*: Either, either they'll talk to the tech there. Either don't email the company. Company directly either by phone, by email or they'll send it at the info. From. Straight from the website or they'll reach out to the property manager or to the building manager or like there's all these ways that just can't be funneled in one place. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:41]*: Yeah. Which is organized. 
**Speaker 2** *[17:45]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:46]*: Ultra organized, transparent. The building maintenance company can. Hey Tommy, you're on this. I see you're on this building today. There's 10 complaints. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:01]*: Tommy can see those. 
**Speaker 1** *[18:02]*: Yeah, go. Yeah, you can see those complaints. Go take care of those complaints today. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:07]*: Yeah, I don't need to, I don't need like you don't need to send Tommy a text with 10 different unit number and cuz that's literally what I was doing. I would go in and put my 10 unit number in my note app. 
**Speaker 1** *[18:22]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:23]*: Knock at each door and then either no resident not home or go to the next one, talk to the resident, blah blah. Take all this, send it to Jeff. And then two weeks later it would be like did you go back to 1037? I don't, I don't find you note I can't see. You know my phone. Like what happened to that 1037. 
**Speaker 1** *[18:45]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:45]*: Yeah. Then you're just like oh my God, it's been two weeks. 
**Speaker 1** *[18:48]*: Where was it a good. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:50]*: In two weeks I have notes and notes of complaints. Right. In the summer that's all I would do every day. I would go knock on doors and take notes. I mean like oh man, the water for 1037. Where is this? Oh yeah, he wasn't there. I haven't gone back because I forgot. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:10]*: Okay. So that dovetails in with the residents portal. So for authentication. So there's. I'm just going to read out some of the problems solved here. Unauthorized data access, multi tenant isolation. Ensures employees only see their own company's data. Perfect. One size fits all permissions. Granular permission system lets you customize exactly which employee can access great financial data. Exposure sensitive pricing and payroll information hidden unless explicitly granted. That's correct. 
**Speaker 2** *[19:41]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:42]*: Complex onboarding. Temporary passwords with forced reset ensure secure first time employee setup. 
**Speaker 2** *[19:50]*: Temporary password with forced reset ensure first. No. Well, it is. The employer creates the password, whatever he wants and it will stay as is until the employee goes in and. And change their password. Right. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:13]*: But it's not forced on first login. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:15]*: No. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:16]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:16]*: It is not. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:21]*: Okay. May. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:21]*: Maybe I. To me, I. Jeff, like when you created my clock. Whatever. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:28]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:28]*: I just logged in. I don't care what the password is. Right. I just left it. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:35]*: Okay, so it's not forced, but the employee can change it if they want to. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:40]*: Yes. They go in their account and then change password. They have to enter the old one and then the new one twice. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:47]*: External stakeholder access. Residents and property managers get controlled read only access without admin overhead. So that's not entirely true. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:57]*: No. Because. Because resident can submit complaints. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:00]*: Complaints and stuff. 
**Speaker 2** *[21:01]*: That's not the only. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:03]*: Yeah. Okay. So that needs to. Are there any other problems that this. 
**Speaker 2** *[21:15]*: I mean they do get read only when it comes to the building. They can't change the project details. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:21]*: Right. And they can't change the progress of no project at all. 
**Speaker 2** *[21:25]*: No. So that is read only. Like the project details is read only. Then they can submit. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:31]*: Yeah. Complaints. 
**Speaker 2** *[21:34]*: Complaints. Right. So yeah, I would say it is. It is read only, actually. It's like if I. If I don't pay for Excel and I open a document, I only let's read only. But I'm still able to create an account or buy a subscription or do separate things. Right. But Excel is read only, which is the same thing. Like the building will be read only. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:00]*: But you can read only with complaint submission permission. 
**Speaker 2** *[22:06]*: Yeah. So yeah, the project details is. Is real. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:14]*: Great. Do you want to. Can you go down to authentication flow? 
**Speaker 2** *[22:18]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:20]*: Visit register page, enter company name, email. 
**Speaker 2** *[22:23]*: Password, account, company registration. So. Do you want to put the. The buying. No. So yeah, no, that's not. So. It goes. They go to like a get free or whatever, get started. Then it goes straight to Stripe and then they enter their payment information. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:54]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[22:55]*: Once this is done. Once it's. It's processed, it creates the account already. It provide like the license key. It sends everything in the database. Now they just have to enter company name, email password and continue and that will create the account and take them straight inside the app. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:21]*: Okay. And that's creating the company. And from there they enter their information. 
**Speaker 2** *[23:29]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:30]*: Then they can start adding employees. 
**Speaker 2** *[23:32]*: Yeah. So yeah, once. Once they buy it, they enter a little bit of information like name, company name, Email, stuff like that, like three or four times. Then it takes them to their account page, where now they can enter the company address, their own salary, if their own rope. They want to track. Right. Their cost of washing windows. Right. Then they enter all of their company details, and then from there you can add employees and the. Property manager. And the resident code is created at the same time. It's always visible on top. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:11]*: The resident code. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:14]*: Yeah. So the resident, you create your account, and then after that there's a button. So they create your account. My name, blah, unit, parking stalls. Now they're in the app, but there's nothing until they enter the company code that is on the notice in the elevator. Okay. And then. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:34]*: Okay. And this is on the resident account, not on employee onboarding or anything like that. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:40]*: Yeah. So but that code, every single employee, owner, and everybody can see it. So if, like, the guy is on, like on the ground, and then a resident comes in. Oh, when will you be done? Oh, we'll be done on Wednesday. But you can go on the app. And here's the. Here's the code. Just enter that and you'll see all the details. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:58]*: Right. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:59]*: Oh, my windows are dirty. Okay, no problem. I have to hop back on rope right now. But go on the app, add the. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:06]*: Add. 
**Speaker 2** *[25:06]*: Here's the code. And it's also in the elevator. Just fill out your. Your feedback there and then we'll get back to you. This is. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:18]*: I don't know if this change. This probably changes things too much, fundamentally. Do we want to change it from complaints to feedback? 
**Speaker 2** *[25:27]*: It is feedback. Then the app. It says feedback. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:30]*: It says feedback, not complaints. 
**Speaker 2** *[25:31]*: No, it says feedback. Feedback. I. I changed it because I didn't like it either. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:36]*: Yeah. So throughout the documentation and stuff like that, we should probably change it to feedback so that we have the same. 
**Speaker 2** *[25:51]*: Wait a minute here. So let me log in as a resident. Oh, I don't have a resident anymore. What was it my quick button for resident. Oh, wait a minute. Working this one. Okay, so on the resident. Side. Oh, no, it says complaints on the resident side. Yeah, yeah, I'll change that to feedback. Are you taking note of all this? Yeah, because I'm not. 
**Speaker 1** *[26:37]*: Yeah. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[26:39]*: Okay, so I'll change it to Feedback. Feedback. I guess I could put it as feedback everywhere on the. On the project side. 
**Speaker 1** *[26:46]*: Should be. Should probably like it. Yeah, it should be. Codified as feedback. 
**Speaker 2** *[26:54]*: So how do you. Because that's another thing. If you want to put that in. The note that I have to do is like a rating for Complaints. Like how the company handles complaints. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:07]*: Oh, right. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:08]*: Like a time rating. Like a time. Like how long does it take usually? Like an average response time. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:14]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:15]*: And then an average. From when it's open to close. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:20]*: Right. So there needs to be a. There needs to be. Yeah, Like a timer from. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:28]*: Yeah. From date to date, from the time. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:31]*: The customer says, I have a problem. I have a problem to the time that the company closes. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:36]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:37]*: Ticket. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:37]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:40]*: Yeah. So that's not done yet. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:41]*: That's not done yet. So if you want to add that in there so I can. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:45]*: Yeah, no problem. 
**Speaker 2** *[27:49]*: So what would you call this? That rating? A feedback Response. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:55]*: Yeah, Feedback response. It's good response rating. Feedback. It is. Yeah. Feedback response. Rating feedback response. 
**Speaker 2** *[28:16]*: I'm not sure about feedback. I feel like feedback doesn't fit with. My windows are dirty or you didn't clean my drive. 
**Speaker 1** *[28:26]*: Yeah. Feedback is more like, I really didn't. 
**Speaker 2** *[28:31]*: Like the service today. 
**Speaker 1** *[28:32]*: Yeah. So maybe there's a different word that we need to use other than feedback. 
**Speaker 2** *[28:42]*: Not complaints. Something between complaints and feedback. But it could also be feedback. Right. I just. I don't want two buttons. I want a one button. That means. That means feedback and complaints. 
**Speaker 1** *[28:55]*: Right. Well, let's. 
**Speaker 2** *[29:04]*: It. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[29:39]*: It says feedback is probably the best single word. It naturally encompasses both complaints and positive input. Other options, depending on contacts, would be comments. Input, reviews. 
**Speaker 2** *[29:55]*: Comments. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:02]*: We could do like, comments could be like anything, though, I think. But. Yeah, I guess, like, your response. Rating to comments is. Just as important. 
**Speaker 2** *[30:24]*: Comments, but like the. You know, like you. There's customer that are really. And they like it. Right. They like to complain. They'll find something to complain, whatever it is. Even if it's perfect. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:41]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[30:43]*: And you kind of need to like. I want. I want. I want to satisfy this urge for that. Right. You want to complain. Here it is. And then to me, if I was like that type of person, I be. Comment. I don't want to comment. I want to. About that service. And I kind of want them to be, like, satisfied with. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:08]*: Yeah. But I think feedback's the right word, honestly. Because that's. It's like, I want to give you my feedback. 
**Speaker 2** *[31:17]*: Yeah. Could you. Could we do, like, feedback slash complaint? Feedback slash comment. I know. I guess feedback is. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:33]*: I don't know. 
**Speaker 2** *[31:34]*: I think it. Here's my feedback about. I wonder what. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:36]*: I think it. It encompasses both positive and negative. 
**Speaker 2** *[31:41]*: Yeah. While staying positive. It's not a negative. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:48]*: It's not like a. Yeah. It's not like a. The word complaint is a negative. 
**Speaker 2** *[31:53]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:53]*: It's 100 negative for everybody. Yeah. And what if the feedback is positive? Like, hey, you guys did an amazing job on my. On my window. That opens up. It opens it up for that as well. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:06]*: Yeah. Because if people want to say you did a great job, they're not going to go and click on complaints. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:13]*: Yeah. That guy, he had a shirt. I think his name is Tommy. The shorts that he was wearing while he washing my window. Amazing. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:24]*: Yeah. Love it. Yeah. I would like him to do my window. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:28]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:28]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:36]*: Okay. A little. Went on a little side quest there. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:41]*: Okay. Feedback slash request. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:53]*: Yeah, I don't think it really matters. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:54]*: Yeah, Feedback. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:55]*: I think feedback is fine. 
**Speaker 2** *[32:57]*: Okay, move on. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:00]*: So resident PM linking user registers as a resident or property manager. 
**Speaker 2** *[33:05]*: Let me just. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:06]*: Receives linking code from company, enters code on link page. System validates code and creates link. If a company changes code, the link is invalidated on next API call. 
**Speaker 2** *[33:17]*: Wait a minute, where are you at? I have to log out of there to go. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:21]*: Authentication flow down on resident SL PM linking. 
**Speaker 2** *[33:30]*: Oh, God. User register at resin. Receives linking code. Company. Link page. System validates. Code and create System validate code and create link. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:53]*: Creates the link together. 
**Speaker 2** *[33:54]*: Oh, okay. I guess I could say it's creating. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:57]*: A link to system validates code and links. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:04]*: Yes. Yes, that'd better. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:07]*: And links, what are they linking to? They're linking the building. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:10]*: Building to the vendor. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:12]*: To the vendor? 
**Speaker 2** *[34:13]*: Yeah. If company changes code against invalidated from next API call. If company changes code. Company will not. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:27]*: Company would never change the code. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:29]*: No. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:29]*: So number five on resident PM linking is irrelevant. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:33]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:33]*: And should be removed. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:41]*: Security architectures. Server science sessions. I don't know what that means. Automatic session. I do not know if that's. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:54]*: I think that's all good. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:56]*: CSR enough protection. I actually read about that yesterday because. Replit suggested that when I asked to check for security. What is it again? It's for. Password to be more secure. But else. Oh, it's a protection against. Against brutal force. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:22]*: Like DDoS attacks. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:23]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:24]*: Type of thing. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:24]*: Yeah. So it will limit. I didn't implement it. So it will limit. What is it? Brute force attack. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:33]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:33]*: Where like an attack would send like a million requests at the same time and try to find like an open port. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:39]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:40]*: That will limit the attempt to 10 to 15 in one minute. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:45]*: Right. Okay. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:46]*: From. Yeah, yeah. You can't leave it there. I don't think that's great. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:51]*: I think the. Yeah, these things are fine. 
**Speaker 2** *[35:55]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:55]*: Data isolation, company based experience. Yeah. Role based API response. 
**Speaker 2** *[36:00]*: That makes sense. Every request. Yeah. Of it trails for sensitive actions. What is that? 
**Speaker 1** *[36:10]*: Just creates a. Like a change log. But for I. I like the importance of it. I don't know, like somebody who's a security tech would probably understand what that means. 
**Speaker 2** *[36:26]*: Everybody employed by 1 user, 2 users. Request Request data. Yeah. Yeah. So. Again, the last. The quick reference. Who can do what that. That can change that. 
**Speaker 1** *[36:45]*: That's variable. Yeah. That's flexible. Depending on what they selected. 
**Speaker 2** *[36:50]*: That is just the rope access. But hey, I'm thinking of maybe putting you as a supervisor. Let's see how it goes. I'm giving you permissions to create projects now because now employee can't create projects. Right, right. So I'm going to give you that one permission. 
**Speaker 1** *[37:07]*: So that's. That section is variable depending on like how the company. The company owner sets up that account. 
**Speaker 2** *[37:15]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[37:16]*: Okay. Okay. I think that we're good on the user access and authentication guide. That's probably enough. 
**Speaker 2** *[37:28]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[37:28]*: For right now. Back to knowledge base. So. The next one. Standby. I'm just going to.
