**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025
**Target Audience:** Building Residents (B2C)
**Source Documents:** Module_Resident_Portal_SSOT_v1.md, Resident Portal User Guide
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** Building residents whose building is serviced by an OnRopePro vendor
**Awareness Level:** Problem-aware (frustrated with current communication) or unaware (just received vendor code)
**Primary Psychological Frameworks:**
- **Transparency/Accountability** - "Viewed" timestamps eliminate "I didn't see it" excuses
- **Autonomy** - Direct control over communication, no middlemen
- **Relief** - End of phone tag, lost emails, repeated explanations
- **Cognitive Load Reduction** - One place for everything

**Emotional Territory:** Relief, validation ("finally someone gets it"), control

**Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) with Before-After-Bridge elements

## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Know Your Feedback Was Received. Track It Until It's Resolved.**

### Alternative Headlines

1. **Stop Wondering If Anyone Heard You. Start Seeing Proof.**
2. **Your Building. Your Window. Your Direct Line to the Crew.**

### Subheadline

Submit feedback with photos, see exactly when it was viewed, and track progress in real-time. No more phone calls. No more guessing.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

**Tired of Complaints That Go Nowhere?**

### Body Copy

You email the property manager about streaks on your window. A week passes. Nothing. You call. They say they forwarded it to the vendor. The vendor says they never got it.

Now three people are involved in tracking down one email that may or may not have been sent.

Meanwhile, you see crews working on the building but have no idea if they've reached your side yet. You call again. Turns out they finished your floor yesterday.

The Resident Portal puts you in direct contact with the service company working on your building. Submit once. See when it was viewed. Track it through to resolution.

## 3. What You Can Do

### Section Header

**Your Portal. Your Control.**

### Intro Copy

The Resident Portal gives you direct access to project updates and a documented communication channel with the service team.

### Card 1: Track Project Progress

See exactly where crews are working and when they'll reach your side of the building. Real-time progress bars show which elevations are complete, so you know when to move plants off the balcony or prepare for window access.

**What you see:**
- Which side of the building is being worked on now
- Completion percentage for each elevation
- Expected completion timeline
- No more premature "you missed my window" calls

### Card 2: Submit Feedback with Photos

Report issues, concerns, or compliments directly through the portal. Attach photos right from your phone. One submission captures your name, unit number, and the visual evidence needed for fast resolution.

**What you can submit:**
- Streaks, spots, or missed areas
- Damage concerns
- Access issues (plants, furniture in the way)
- Compliments for work well done

### Card 3: Track Your Feedback Status

Every submission is timestamped and tracked. See when the company first viewed your feedback. Watch the status change from New to Viewed to Closed. No more wondering if anyone saw it.

**What you track:**
- Submission date and time
- "Viewed" timestamp showing when the company saw it
- Current status (New, Viewed, Closed)
- Responses from the service team

## 4. How It Works

### Section Header

**Three Steps to Direct Communication**

### Step 1: Create Your Account

Sign up with your email, strata plan number, and unit number. This links your account to your specific building and unit. Takes about two minutes.

### Step 2: Enter the Vendor Code

Your building manager or property manager provides a vendor code. Enter it once in your profile to connect with the service company working on your building.

### Step 3: See Projects and Submit Feedback

Your dashboard shows active projects on your building. View progress. Submit feedback. Track responses. Everything in one place.

**Note:** Your account stays with you. If you move to a different building, update your strata number and enter the new vendor's code. No need to start over.

## 5. Problems Solved

### Section Header

**Real Problems. Real Solutions.**

### Problem 1: "My complaint disappeared into a black hole."

You submitted feedback via email or phone. Days pass. No response. You follow up. They can't find it. You explain the whole thing again. Still nothing.

With the Resident Portal, every submission is logged with a timestamp. You see the exact date and time the company opened your feedback. "I didn't see it" becomes impossible when you can prove they viewed it on Tuesday at 2:47 PM.

### Problem 2: "I explained this three times already."

Phone to property manager. Property manager to vendor. Vendor to technician. Somewhere along the way, "water stain on bedroom window" became "balcony glass issue." The tech arrives confused.

Submit once through the portal. Your name, unit, phone, and description are captured. Attach photos. Done. The team sees exactly what you see. No telephone game.

### Problem 3: "I have no idea if they've done my window yet."

Crews are on the building. You can see them from the street. But are they on the north side or south? Did they finish your floor yesterday or is it scheduled for next week?

The portal shows real-time progress by elevation. You know your side hasn't been touched yet. You wait. No wasted calls asking "are you done?"

### Problem 4: "They said they'd fix it but nothing changed."

Feedback submitted. Response received. Issue marked closed. But nothing actually improved. Now what?

You can see the status history and any responses from the team. If the issue persists after closure, contact your building manager with documented proof of what was communicated.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get the vendor code?

Contact your building manager or property manager. They receive the vendor code from the service company and share it with residents.

### Can I access the portal from my phone?

Yes. The portal works on any device with internet access: phone, tablet, or computer.

### What if I move to a different unit in the same building?

Update your unit number in your account settings. Your strata plan number stays the same.

### What if I move to a different building?

Update both your strata plan number and unit number. Enter the new vendor's code when you receive it from your new building manager.

### Can other residents see my feedback?

No. You can only see feedback you submitted. Building managers and the service company can see all feedback for the building, but other residents cannot.

### What happens if my feedback is closed but the issue persists?

Only the company can reopen closed feedback. If you believe an issue wasn't fully resolved, contact your building manager or property manager with documented proof from the portal.

### Can I submit positive feedback?

Absolutely. The system accepts all types of input: concerns, compliments, questions, and suggestions.

### How long do I have to submit feedback after work is done?

Residents have 5 business days after project completion to submit feedback. This window allows time to notice issues while keeping the complaint period reasonable.

### Is my data secure?

Yes. Your account uses encrypted passwords and secure sessions. Your feedback is private and visible only to you and authorized personnel.

## 9. Get Started

### Section Header

No more wondering. No more waiting. No more repeating yourself.

## Implementation Notes

### Psychological Triggers Used

1. **Loss Aversion (inverted):** "No more lost complaints" frames the portal as protection against losing your voice
2. **Autonomy:** "Your portal. Your control." Direct action without middlemen
3. **Transparency:** Viewed timestamps create accountability
4. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** "One place for everything" vs. phone/email/calls scattered everywhere
5. **Social Proof (implicit):** "Your building is already using this system" normalizes adoption

### Tone Calibration

- Conversational, not corporate
- Acknowledges frustration without dwelling on negativity
- Empowering, not condescending
- Direct, no hedge words
- Second person throughout ("you," "your")

### Format Notes

- No em-dashes (TSX compatibility)
- Present tense for all features
- Specific numbers where validated (24 hours, 5 business days, 3-5 days to 24 hours)
- Active voice throughout

### A/B Test Recommendations

1. **Headline Test:** "Know Your Feedback Was Received" vs. "Stop Wondering If Anyone Heard You"
2. **Problem Statement Test:** Lead with "black hole" complaint vs. lead with "crews on building" progress visibility
3. **CTA Test:** "Create Your Account" vs. "Get Your Portal Access"
