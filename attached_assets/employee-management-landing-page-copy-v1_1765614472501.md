## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware to Solution-aware  
Small to medium rope access company owners who know onboarding and certification tracking are painful, but assume scattered tools are the only option.

**Core Insight:**  
Rope access technicians are highly mobile professionals. Most workforce software treats employees as employer-owned records that must be recreated from scratch with every hire. This creates redundant data entry, compliance gaps, and administrative chaos during an industry's highest-turnover seasons.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Loss Aversion:** Protect your business from WorkSafeBC shutdowns, liability exposure, expired certifications
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** One system replaces 8 apps, one profile follows techs between employers
3. **Status Quo Bias Disruption:** Show the hidden cost of "good enough" scattered systems
4. **Reciprocity:** Free technician accounts build trust and drive adoption

**Emotional Territory:** Relief, Protection, Control

## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**Your New Hire Filled Out This Paperwork Three Employers Ago. Why Are You Asking Again?**

### Alternative Headlines

1. One Expired Certification. One WorkSafeBC Visit. One Shutdown You Didn't See Coming.
2. Stop Rebuilding Employee Records From Scratch Every Season.
3. 10 Seconds to Onboard an Existing Tech. 8 Fewer Apps to Manage.

### Subheadline

Portable technician identities, automated certification alerts, and instant onboarding for the industry with the highest turnover in construction. Employee management built by rope access professionals who got tired of the same paperwork dance at every new job.

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

**The Onboarding Problem Nobody Admits**

### Body Copy

You email the new guy. "Welcome to the team. Please send your IRATA cert, void check, emergency contact, driver's license, and fill out these forms."

He sends half of it. You chase the rest. You manually enter everything into your systems. Three days later, he's finally in the schedule.

Then he leaves for a competitor paying $2 more per hour. Eight weeks later, you hire him back. The whole dance starts again. Same guy. Same paperwork. Same wasted hours.

Meanwhile, somewhere in a spreadsheet you haven't opened since February, someone's IRATA cert expired last month. WorkSafeBC hasn't shown up yet. But they will.

OnRopePro treats technicians like what they are: mobile professionals whose complete professional identity should follow them wherever they work. Enter their IRATA number, they accept the connection, and every piece of information from their last three employers transfers instantly. One profile. Every employer. Zero redundant paperwork.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header

**What This Module Does**

### Intro Copy

Complete workforce administration for rope access operations, from first-day onboarding to certification compliance to offboarding.

### Card 1: Portable Professional Identities

Every technician's IRATA or SPRAT certification number becomes their permanent identifier across the OnRopePro network. When they change employers (and they will), their profile travels with them.

**What transfers automatically:**
- Personal and contact information
- All certifications with expiration dates
- Emergency contact details
- Banking and payment information
- Complete work history and project records

### Card 2: Certification Compliance Engine

The system monitors IRATA, SPRAT, driver's licenses, and First Aid certifications. Visual indicators (green, amber, red) make expiring credentials impossible to miss. Automated 30-day warnings give you time to act before problems become crises.

**What gets tracked:**
- IRATA certification levels and expiration
- SPRAT certification status
- Driver's license validity (for vehicle assignments)
- First Aid and safety training dates

### Card 3: Granular Permission Controls

All roles start with zero permissions except Company Owner. You configure exactly what each person can see and do. Separate operational access from financial visibility. Protect sensitive business data without formal demotions.

**What you control:**
- Financial data visibility (pricing, costs, pay rates)
- Employee management capabilities
- Project creation and viewing rights
- Payroll access levels
- Client information exposure

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Rope Access Company Owners

**Protect your operation from compliance disasters before they happen.** One certification alert preventing a WorkSafeBC shutdown pays for your entire annual subscription. Beyond direct cost, you avoid project delays, client relationship damage, and liability lawsuits that can reach seven figures.

**Reclaim hours lost to redundant administration.** The email chase, the data entry, the follow-ups, the duplicate effort when someone comes back after leaving for another company. Existing OnRopePro users onboard in 10 seconds. New users fill out their information once on their own time.

**Control access without creating HR conflicts.** Suspicious your operations manager is talking to competitors? Modify their permissions in real-time without changing their title. Remove financial visibility while maintaining operational function. Document everything for potential legal proceedings.

### For Technicians

**Fill out paperwork once in your career, not once per employer.** Your profile follows you. When you join a new company, they enter your IRATA number, you accept, and you're done. No more emailing the same void check to every new employer.

**Never get blindsided by an expired certification.** See your own status. Get notified before expiration. Renew on your schedule instead of scrambling after you've already lost work eligibility.

**Log in with your IRATA number.** The credential that defines your profession becomes your universal identifier. One less password to remember.

### For Operations Managers

**Know who's qualified for what at a glance.** Scheduling a technical job that needs a Level 3? Filter by certification level. Assigning a company vehicle? Check license status instantly. Stop relying on memory for compliance-critical decisions.

**Onboard new crew members without the email marathon.** For techs already in OnRopePro, you're not creating records. You're connecting to profiles that already exist. For new users, the system handles the data collection.

### For Building Managers

**Verify technician qualifications before anyone touches your building.** Current IRATA certifications. Valid safety training. Proper insurance documentation. Professional operators who can prove compliance on demand.

**Work with companies that operate like professionals.** Organized record-keeping. Documented safety protocols. The kind of operation that doesn't create liability exposure for your property.

### For Property Managers

**Confidence in your vendor's workforce management.** When you need to justify your vendor selection to ownership or insurance, you can point to systematic compliance tracking and professional documentation.

**Reduce your liability exposure through verified qualifications.** Companies using OnRopePro can demonstrate current certifications for every technician on your properties.

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy

Every feature designed around how rope access companies actually operate, not how generic HR software thinks you should.

### Feature Grid

**10-Second Employee Import**  
Existing OnRopePro users plug in instantly. Enter their IRATA number, send a connection request, they accept, done. All personal information, certifications, emergency contacts, and banking details transfer automatically. You only configure compensation specific to this employment relationship.

**14 Roles with Custom Permissions**  
Management positions (Owner, Operations Manager, Office Manager, Safety Manager, Supervisor, Estimator, Foreman, Project Manager) and field positions (Rope Access Technician L1/L2/L3, Ground Crew, Labourer, Driver). Every role except Owner starts empty. You grant exactly what each person needs.

**Visual Certification Status**  
Green means valid. Amber means expiring within 60 days. Red means expired. No spreadsheet diving. No calendar reminders you might miss. Status is visible wherever you view employee information.

**Driver Eligibility Tracking**  
License expiration dates monitored alongside certifications. Same 30-day warning system. Same visual indicators. Critical for companies assigning technicians to company vehicles.

**Integrated Safety Document Signing**  
New employees automatically receive required company safety documents as part of onboarding. Signatures tracked. Compliance documented. No separate system or email chain required.

**Soft Delete with Data Preservation**  
Terminated employees lose system access immediately, but historical data remains for compliance and audit purposes. Work sessions, safety documents, equipment assignments, payroll history. All preserved for when you need it.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Rope Access Company Owners

**"I didn't know his cert was expired until WorkSafeBC showed up."**

You're running busy season. Jobs stacked, crews deployed across multiple sites. Tracking when every technician's IRATA expires? It falls through the cracks. You assume they're handling their own renewals. Then WorkSafeBC arrives for a site inspection. One company owner described it: "We had a guy on rope and WorkSafeBC showed up. We called and said get off your rope and leave." They caught it in time. If they hadn't, the entire site shuts down.

OnRopePro monitors every certification with automated 30-day warnings and visual status indicators. One alert preventing one shutdown justifies years of subscription costs.

**"Onboarding takes hours of back-and-forth emails."**

Every new hire triggers the same dance. Email asking for info, wait, chase missing pieces, manually enter everything, email safety documents, wait for signatures, follow up again. Hours per employee. High turnover means you're doing this constantly.

Two pathways eliminate this chaos. Existing OnRopePro user: enter IRATA number, they accept, done. 10 seconds. New user: they fill out their profile once on their own time. You just link them to your company.

**"My operations manager might be talking to competitors."**

You've given them broad access because they need it to do their job. Now you're suspicious. You can't fire without proof. You can't run operations without someone in that role. Traditional systems force all-or-nothing access.

Granular permissions let you modify access in real-time without changing titles. Remove financial visibility, hide client information, restrict to basic functions. No formal demotion. No HR complications. Immediate protection.

**"One of my guys drove our truck for two months with an expired license."**

You check licenses at hiring. What happens six months later when they expire? You're not thinking about it. Neither are they. Then they're driving your vehicle without valid credentials and you don't know until something goes wrong.

OnRopePro tracks driver's license expiration alongside certifications. Same 30-day warnings. Same visual indicators. Prevent one insurance claim denial or liability lawsuit and you've justified years of subscription.

### For Operations Managers

**"I can't remember who's certified for what."**

You know Dave is Level 3 and pretty sure Mike is Level 2, but what about the new guys? When scheduling, you're doing mental gymnastics trying to remember who can lead, who needs supervision, who has working at heights training that's still valid.

Filter by certification level, check license status, see first aid expiration. The information exists where you're already making scheduling decisions.

### For Technicians

**"I have to fill out the same paperwork at every new employer."**

Rope access has insane turnover. You might work for three companies in one season. Each one wants the same information: IRATA cert, void check, emergency contact, driver's license. You've filled this out a dozen times.

Create your OnRopePro profile once. When you join a new company, they enter your IRATA number, you accept, and everything transfers. Your certifications, contacts, banking info, work history. One profile, every employer.

**"I never know if my certifications are about to expire."**

You're focused on the job, not calendar dates. Your IRATA lapses, your first aid expires, and suddenly you can't work until you get recertified. Lost income. Scrambling to schedule training. Maybe losing your position to someone else.

OnRopePro tracks your certification dates and alerts you before expiration. Proactive renewal instead of reactive scrambling.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header

**Stop Managing Paperwork. Start Managing People.**

### Body Copy

Right now, you're spending hours on administrative tasks that don't move your business forward. Chasing down documents. Entering the same information multiple times. Manually checking calendars to see if certifications are still valid. Worrying about the compliance gap you might not even know exists.

Your operations manager asks if you can take a new project. You have to check six different places to figure out who's available, who's qualified, and whether anyone's cert is about to expire. By the time you have an answer, the opportunity might be gone.

Your best technician leaves for $2 more an hour somewhere else. Two months later, he wants to come back. You're thrilled to have him, but now you're doing the whole onboarding dance again. Same guy. Same paperwork. Like the last eight months never happened.

With Employee Management, technician profiles are portable. Certifications are monitored automatically. Permissions are configurable without HR complications. When someone joins your company, they're productive on day one. When someone leaves and returns, the connection takes 10 seconds.

You get back the hours you're currently spending on administration. You get protection from compliance failures you didn't know were coming. You get control over who sees what without creating workplace drama.

You stop managing paperwork and start managing what actually matters: your people, your projects, your business.

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

**Can technicians login with their IRATA number instead of email?**  
Yes. Technicians can log in using either their IRATA/SPRAT certification number or their email address. The certification number serves as a unique identifier across the platform.

**What happens when I hire a tech who already has an OnRopePro account?**  
Enter their IRATA/SPRAT number, send a connection request, and once they accept, their full profile transfers to your company. You only configure their compensation rate. All other information is already complete. Time required: 10 seconds (excluding their acceptance).

**Are role permissions predefined or do I have to set them up?**  
All roles except Company Owner start with zero permissions. You must explicitly grant each permission the employee needs. This prevents accidental over-permission and allows precise matching of access to job requirements and trust level.

**Does the system alert for driver's license expiration too?**  
Yes. Driver's license expiration dates are tracked and included in the same alert system as IRATA/SPRAT certifications. Visual indicators and notifications function identically.

**What happens to data when an employee is terminated?**  
The employee loses system access immediately, but all historical data is preserved. Work sessions, safety documents, equipment assignments, and payroll history remain in the system for compliance and audit purposes. This is a soft delete, not a hard delete.

**Can I use this for employees who aren't rope access technicians?**  
Yes. While certification tracking is designed for rope access (IRATA/SPRAT), the module supports roles like Labourer, Ground Crew, and general support staff who may not have rope access certifications. Leave certification fields empty for non-certified staff.

**What if I suspect an employee is sharing information with competitors?**  
Modify their permissions immediately. Remove financial access, hide client information, restrict to basic functions. No formal demotion required. Changes take effect instantly. Access modifications are logged for potential legal proceedings.

**Can employees see each other's pay rates?**  
Only if you grant them that specific permission. Financial visibility is separated from operational access. Your supervisor can create projects and check budgets without seeing what every technician earns.

**What certifications are tracked?**  
IRATA level and expiration, SPRAT certification, driver's license validity, and First Aid certification. All display visual status indicators (green/amber/red) and trigger 30-day warning alerts before expiration.

**How long does onboarding take for a completely new employee?**  
5-10 minutes for data entry, excluding the time the employee spends setting up their own account. New employees receive login credentials via email and can then complete their profile details (emergency contacts, banking information) on their own time.

Test loss aversion ("One Expired Certification. One WorkSafeBC Visit.") against efficiency ("10 Seconds to Onboard an Existing Tech") to determine which emotional trigger drives more conversions.

**Test 2: Problem Statement Length**  
Test current three-paragraph problem statement against a shorter, punchier version that jumps to solution faster. Measure scroll depth and conversion.

**Test 3: Hero Image Concept**  
Test image of stacked paperwork being replaced by phone screen against image of WorkSafeBC inspector arriving at job site. Measure emotional response and click-through.
