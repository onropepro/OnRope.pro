# Work Session & Time Tracking Module

## Hero Section

**Eyebrow Text:** Work Sessions & Time Tracking

**Primary Headline:**
"You were there all week. The building is only 20% done. What happened?"

**Alternative Headlines:**
1. "6 programs. 7 spreadsheets. Zero clarity. Sound familiar?"
2. "Your payroll is wrong. Your technician knows it. And you're about to find out."

**Subheadline:**
Monday was windy. Tuesday he left early. Wednesday there was a crane on the roof. Thursday Damien felt sick. By Friday, you're 20 hours over budget and you have no idea why.

OnRopePro's Work Session module captures everything. Clock in, clock out, drops completed, shortfall reasons documented. Real answers instead of scattered excuses.

**Hero Stats (4):**
| 87-93% | $3,600+ | 30 min | 4 |
|--------|---------|--------|---|
| Payroll time saved | Annual errors eliminated | Instead of 7 hours | Elevations tracked per building |

## Problem Statement Section

**Section Header:** The Conversation You Know Too Well

**Body Copy:**

"I see you logged 45 hours. Last year one guy finished the same building in that time. You're not even halfway done. What happened?"

"Monday, I think it was windy. And then I had to pull my rope, I think. Or was that Tuesday? Oh yeah, no, Tuesday because Monday I had to leave early because I had dinner with my mom and I told you, remember? Oh yeah, I remember you told me that. Then Tuesday was windy and then Wednesday there was another crane on the roof, so I had to move my rope a bunch of times. And what about Damien? He was there with you. Oh yeah, but he felt sick. He didn't work so much and he only did one drop on Thursday or Friday. I'm not sure. I was not really paying attention to what he was doing. I was too busy with my stuff."

No clue what's going on. At the end of the building, you're just pissed off because you went 20 hours over budget and you don't really know why. You know it was weather. You know the guy wasn't feeling well some days. You don't really know. Move on. Next building.

**This is the system you're using.** Memory. Excuses. Spreadsheets that don't connect to anything.

OnRopePro replaces the guesswork with data. Every clock-in timestamped. Every clock-out GPS-verified. Every drop logged by elevation. Every shortfall documented with a reason. Next year when you quote that building, you're not guessing. You're calculating.

## What This Module Does

**Section Header:** What This Module Does
**Subheadline:** Three capabilities. Zero chaos.

Work sessions are the core time tracking mechanism. When a technician starts their day on a project, the system records their start time, location, and links the session to both the project and their payroll. At the end of the day, they log their work output and the session closes.

### Card 1: Precision Time Capture

Technicians clock in from their phone. The system captures the exact timestamp and GPS location. No more "I swear I was there by 8."

**What gets tracked:**
- Start time (to the second)
- GPS coordinates at clock-in
- Project association
- Harness inspection verification

### Card 2: Work Output Documentation

At end of day, technicians log drops completed by elevation. North, East, South, West. Miss your daily target? The system prompts for a reason. Weather. Equipment. Crew issues. Documented, not forgotten.

**What gets captured:**
- Drops completed per elevation
- Percentage complete (for hours-based jobs)
- Shortfall reasons (mandatory when below target)
- Session photos and notes

### Card 3: Automatic Payroll Aggregation

Hours flow directly into payroll calculations. Regular time, overtime, piece-work. All calculated. Billable versus non-billable separated automatically. Export to QuickBooks, ADP, Paychex, Gusto.

**What gets calculated:**
- Total hours by employee
- Hours by project
- Billable vs non-billable breakdown
- Piece-work compensation (if enabled)

## Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers

**Know exactly where your labor dollars go.** Every work session links to a project. Every hour links to a technician. When a building goes over budget, you see exactly why. Weather delays on Tuesday. Equipment issues Wednesday. Crew shortage Friday. No more reconstructing the week from memory.

**Eliminate payroll disputes permanently.** Both you and your technician see the same timestamps. Same GPS locations. Same drop counts. When the data matches, disputes don't happen. When someone claims hours they didn't work, you have proof.

**Quote future projects from actual data.** Pull up last year's work sessions for that building. See exactly how many hours, which technicians, what productivity rates. Your next quote is based on history, not hope.

### For Technicians

**Clock in, clock out, done.** No timesheets to fill out. No texts to send. No forms to lose. Tap Start Day when you arrive. Tap End Day when you leave. Your hours submit themselves.

**Your work history follows you.** Every project, every building, every task logged and stored. When you apply for a new job or upgrade your IRATA level, you have detailed records. "178 rope transfers. 3,500 deviations. 2,000 drops." Not guesses. Documented facts.

**Fair performance reviews based on data.** Your dashboard shows drops per day, target achievement rate, trends over time. When performance conversations happen, you're discussing facts, not opinions.

### For Operations Managers

**See who's working where right now.** Real-time dashboard shows every clocked-in technician. Which project. How long. Last activity. When a client calls asking if your crew is on site, you know the answer without making phone calls.

**Catch budget problems on Day 3, not Day 30.** Labor costs calculate in real-time against project budgets. When a project starts trending over, you see it immediately. Reassign resources. Adjust timelines. Prevent surprises.

**Document every deviation.** Target missed? Reason captured. Weather delay? Logged. Equipment failure? Recorded. When you review project performance, you have context for every variance.

### For Building Managers

**Verify contractor attendance.** Access your building's work session summaries through the portal. See when crews arrived, when they left, what they accomplished. No more competing stories about who was where.

**Access compliance documentation instantly.** Work sessions link to safety records. Harness inspections verified at clock-in. Toolbox meeting attendance tracked. Your audit folder stays current automatically.

### For Property Managers

**Track vendor performance across your portfolio.** Every building, every contractor, every project. Work session data feeds into Compliance & Safety Ratings visible in your portal. Make renewal decisions based on documented performance.

**Resolve disputes with verified data.** Contractor says they were on site Tuesday through Friday. Your records show work sessions for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday only. Facts end arguments.

## Key Features

**Intro Copy:** Everything you need to track field operations and process accurate payroll.

### One-Tap Clock In/Out
Technicians start and end work sessions from their smartphone. Exact timestamps captured automatically. GPS location recorded. No timesheets, no texts, no paperwork.

### 4-Elevation Drop Tracking
Log drops completed by building side: North, East, South, West. Visual progress bars show exactly where work stands on each facade. Project completion percentage updates in real-time.

### GPS Location Verification
Location captured at clock-in and clock-out. Verifiable proof for client disputes, billing verification, and audit documentation. See the map coordinates for every session.

### Daily Target Enforcement
Set drop targets per project. System tracks whether technicians meet, exceed, or fall short. Miss the target? A reason is required. Weather, equipment, crew issues. Documented every time.

### Automatic Hour Aggregation
Hours total themselves by employee, by project, by payroll period. No spreadsheet formulas. No manual calculations. No transcription errors. Ready for export in 30 seconds.

### Billable vs Non-Billable Separation
Project work tracked separately from travel, errands, training, and admin. Finally see your true billable ratio. Identify where non-productive hours are hiding.

### Piece-Work Calculation
Pay per drop? Toggle piece-work mode per project. System calculates compensation based on drops completed. Works for hourly shops and commission shops alike.

### Manager Override with Audit Trail
Authorized managers can edit completed sessions. Forgot to clock out? Clocked out at the wrong time? Corrections are logged with timestamp and reason. Full accountability.

### Harness Inspection Integration
When technicians click Start Day, they confirm harness inspection status. "Yes" without a matching inspection record creates a CSR penalty. Honest employees build trust. Dishonest answers are passively tracked.

### IRATA/SPRAT Hours Logging
End-of-session prompt captures rope access activities: rigging, rope transfers, deviations, rescue practice. Technicians build detailed work history for certification logbook updates.

## Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"I spend 4 to 8 hours on payroll every two weeks."**

You're reconciling spreadsheets at 10 PM. Text messages from last Tuesday. A voicemail you half-remember. The scribbled note on your desk that might say "8" or might say "3." By midnight you've reconstructed something that's probably close.

OnRopePro captures timestamps automatically. Hours aggregate by employee and project. Export your payroll data in 30 seconds. The 7 hours you used to spend? Gone.

**"My check is $140 short and I want to know why."**

That phone call from your technician. Your stomach drops. You know he's probably right. You spend an hour digging through records, discover you miscounted his overtime, cut a makeup check, and watch another piece of trust evaporate.

Both you and your technician see the same data. Same timestamps. Same totals. When the numbers match, disputes don't happen. When someone's wrong, the proof is immediate.

**"I don't know which projects are profitable until the job is done."**

You finish a building and realize you're $2,000 over budget. Was it weather? Slow technicians? Equipment problems? By the time you piece it together, you've already underbid three similar projects.

Labor costs calculate in real-time against your budget. You see cost per drop. Hours per elevation. Performance against daily targets. When a project starts going sideways, you know it on Day 3.

### For Technicians

**"I fill out the same time info three different ways."**

Text your hours to the office. Write them in your IRATA logbook. Fill out the company spreadsheet. Three systems that never sync. Three chances for errors. Three things to remember at the end of an exhausting day on rope.

One tap to clock in. One tap to clock out. That single entry feeds payroll and stores the details you need for your logbook. Done.

**"I can never remember what I did three weeks ago for my logbook."**

Your IRATA logbook is supposed to be accurate. But when you're filling it out at the end of the month, you're guessing. Was it rope transfers on Tuesday or Wednesday? How many drops did you complete at the parkade?

Every work session logs the details: building, tasks performed, hours, drops by elevation. When you update your physical logbook, you're copying verified data, not reconstructing memories.

**"My supervisor says my performance is inconsistent but has no data to show me."**

You felt like you worked hard. There's nothing to reference. The review becomes about perception, not performance.

Your dashboard shows drops per day, target achievement rate, trends over time. "This month: 4.8 drops/day average, 86% target achievement. Last month: 4.1 drops/day, 72% achievement. You're improving."

### For Operations Managers

**"I don't know where my crew is or what they're doing."**

You call Tommy. No answer. You call again. Nothing. Is he on rope? On break? Having an emergency? You have 12 technicians across 4 sites and zero visibility.

Real-time dashboard shows every clocked-in technician. Which project. How long. Last activity. Answer client calls without making phone calls.

**"The project went 20 hours over budget and I don't know why."**

End of project. You're way over. You know it was weather, a sick technician, some equipment issues. But you can't quantify any of it.

Shortfall reasons are captured when technicians miss daily targets. Every deviation documented. When you review project performance, you see exactly what happened and why.

### For Building Managers

**"I can't verify if the rope access crew was actually on site."**

You're paying for services. The contractor says their crew was there all week. Your residents say they only saw workers Tuesday and Thursday.

GPS-verified clock-in and clock-out times visible in your portal. See when crews arrived, when they left, what they accomplished.

### For Property Managers

**"I need proof of attendance for contractor invoices."**

Contractor submits an invoice for 40 hours. Were they actually there? Your records are whatever the contractor told you.

Work session summaries for your buildings available in your portal. Timestamps, locations, work completed. Verify invoices against documented attendance.

## How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

**Section Header:** Stop Reconstructing. Start Operating.

Right now, you're spending hours every payroll cycle piecing together what happened across your projects. Text messages. Memory. Spreadsheets that don't talk to each other. You're making educated guesses and hoping nobody catches the errors.

Your technicians are logging hours in three different places. Texting the office. Writing in their logbooks. Filling out your forms. Same information, multiple systems, zero connection.

Your operations managers are calling around to find out where people are. Your clients are asking if the crew showed up. Your projects are going over budget and you only find out when the job is done.

With OnRopePro, your technicians clock in once. That single action captures their timestamp, verifies their location, confirms their harness inspection, and links their session to the right project. When they clock out, they log their output, document any shortfalls, and the data flows directly into payroll, performance analytics, and project progress.

You stop reconstructing the past. You start managing in real-time.

## FAQs

**How do technicians clock in and out?**
They use the OnRopePro mobile app. Tap "Start Day" when arriving at site, select the project, confirm harness inspection status. Tap "End Day" when leaving, log drops by elevation, add notes if needed. Takes under 30 seconds.

**What if someone forgets to clock out?**
Authorized managers can edit completed sessions. Adjust the end time, and the system recalculates hours and pay automatically. All edits are logged with timestamp and reason for accountability.

**Can technicians work on multiple projects in one day?**
Yes. End the session at the first project, start a new session at the next. Each project gets accurate hour attribution for billing and cost tracking.

**What happens if GPS is disabled?**
Clock-in still works, but without location verification. The system records that GPS was unavailable. For companies requiring location proof, this creates a visible gap in attendance records.

**How does the harness inspection prompt work?**
When technicians click Start Day, they see three options: Yes (confirms inspection complete), No (redirects to inspection form), or Not Applicable (for ground tasks). Selecting "Yes" without a matching inspection record creates a CSR penalty visible to property managers.

**Who can see work session data?**
Access is permission-based. Company owners and operations managers see all sessions. Supervisors see sessions for their assigned projects. Technicians see their own work history. Property managers see session summaries for their buildings.

**Does this replace the IRATA logbook?**
Not yet. OnRopePro tracks detailed work session information that serves as professional memory. When updating your physical logbook, you reference stored data instead of guessing. We're pursuing IRATA and SPRAT recognition to eventually become an approved logging method.

**Can I export time data for my accountant?**
Yes. Hours aggregate by payroll period with CSV export. Works with QuickBooks, ADP, Paychex, Gusto, and any system that accepts standard time data.

**How does piece-work compensation work?**
When creating a project, toggle piece-work mode and enter the rate per drop. When technicians end their session and log drops completed, the system calculates their compensation automatically and marks it as piece-work in payroll.

**What's the difference between billable and non-billable sessions?**
Billable sessions are linked to client projects. Non-billable sessions cover travel, errands, equipment maintenance, training, and admin. The system tracks both separately so you can see your true billable ratio and identify where non-productive hours are accumulating.
