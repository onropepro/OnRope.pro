### Problems Solved

#### For Rope Access Company Owners

**Problem: "Supervisors accidentally seeing everyone's pay rates"**

You need your supervisor to create projects and assign technicians, but the moment you give them access, they can see what every technician earns. Now your Level 1 tech knows your Level 3 lead makes $18 more per hour. Generic construction software forces you to choose: operational efficiency or payroll privacy.

**Example:** Your operations manager needs to review project budgets to ensure profitability, but you don't want them seeing individual hourly rates. Traditional systems make this impossible—budget access automatically includes rate visibility.

**Solution:** OnRopePro's flexible permission system separates operational capabilities from financial visibility. Grant your supervisor project creation rights, employee assignment capabilities, and schedule management—while keeping hourly rates, labor costs, and payroll data owner-only.

**Benefit:** Delegate confidently without compromising financial privacy. Supervisors manage day-to-day operations without seeing what anyone earns.

---

**Problem: "Financial data visible to people who shouldn't see it"**

Your bookkeeper needs access to generate reports. Your field supervisor needs to check if projects are on budget. But once they're in the system, they can see everything—company-wide profitability, individual employee rates, sensitive client billing margins.

**Example:** You hire a new administrative assistant to help with invoicing. Within a week, they know exactly how much profit you make on each client, what your best technicians earn, and which jobs are money-losers. This isn't malicious—the software just shows everything to anyone with access.

**Solution:** Granular permission controls let you grant exactly what each employee needs. Your bookkeeper sees aggregate labor costs but not individual rates. Your supervisor sees project budgets but not company-wide profitability. Your admin sees client invoices but not internal cost breakdowns.

**Benefit:** Protect sensitive financial information while still delegating operational responsibilities. No more "all or nothing" access decisions.

---

**Problem: "Can't track IRATA certifications"**

You've got 15 technicians with different IRATA levels. Client contracts require Level 2 or higher for certain buildings. Insurance audits demand proof of certification levels. But you're tracking this in a spreadsheet that's always outdated because certifications expire and technicians upgrade.

**Example:** A client asks: "Which of your technicians are Level 2 or 3 and available next week?" You're digging through certification files, checking expiry dates, cross-referencing the schedule. This takes 30 minutes and you're still not confident the data is current.

**Solution:** Each employee profile includes IRATA level (Level 1, 2, or 3) tracked in the system. When you need to assign work or respond to client requirements, you see certification levels instantly alongside availability and hourly rates.

**Benefit:** Instant visibility into team qualifications. Assign work confidently knowing technician certifications match client requirements. Respond to client questions in seconds, not minutes.

---

**Problem: "No control over who can edit/delete projects"**

Everyone with system access can modify or delete projects—including your newest technician who accidentally deleted last month's completed job when trying to log today's drops. Now you've lost all historical data, photos, and time records for client billing.

**Example:** Your supervisor creates a project for a 40-story tower with detailed drop counts per elevation. A technician trying to log drops for a different building accidentally opens this project and changes the North elevation from 120 drops to 12 drops. The error isn't discovered until the project is complete and the client questions why you only invoiced for 12 drops on one side.

**Solution:** Project management permissions control who can create, edit, and delete projects. Restrict these capabilities to supervisors and managers while technicians can only log work and upload photos for projects they're assigned to.

**Benefit:** Protect project data integrity. Prevent accidental deletions and modifications. Maintain accurate records for client billing and historical reference.

---

**Problem: "Crew members changing data they shouldn't access"**

A technician logs into the system and starts browsing. They edit their own hourly rate from $32 to $42 per hour. They change last week's drop counts to show higher productivity. They access and modify other technicians' time records. You discover this during payroll processing when the numbers don't make sense.

**Example:** Your most experienced Level 3 tech knows the system well. During a slow week, he goes into past projects and adds extra drops to his record to make his productivity numbers look better for his upcoming performance review. The client complains months later when reviewing photos that don't match the drop counts you invoiced.

**Solution:** Permission-based access controls what data each employee can view and modify. Technicians see only their own work records and assigned projects. Supervisors can view team performance but can't edit financial data. Only owners and designated managers can modify rates, historical records, and sensitive information.

**Benefit:** Prevent unauthorized data changes. Maintain data integrity for payroll, client billing, and performance reviews. Create clear audit trails showing who accessed and modified what data.

**Problem: "Subscription limit monitoring - using 5 of 8 seats"**

You're on the Tier 1 plan with 8 included seats. You currently have 7 employees but are interviewing for your 8th technician. You hire two people thinking you had space, but discover you're now at 9 seats and being charged $19/month per extra seat. Or worse—you need to hire urgently but don't know if you have available seats without contacting support.

**Example:** Peak season hits. You need to hire 3 temporary technicians immediately to meet demand. But you can't remember if your plan includes 8 seats or 12 seats, and you don't know how many you're currently using. You delay hiring while trying to figure out your subscription status, losing work opportunities.

**Solution:** Employee management dashboard displays your subscription tier limits clearly: "Using 7 of 8 seats" with visual indicators showing capacity. Know instantly if you can add employees or need to upgrade your tier before hiring.

**Benefit:** Make hiring decisions confidently. Avoid surprise overage charges. Plan tier upgrades proactively as your team grows. Never delay hiring because you're unsure about subscription capacity.

#### For Operations Managers & Supervisors

**Problem: "Need to delegate responsibility but can't give full access"**

You're the operations manager coordinating 3-4 concurrent projects. You want your field supervisors to create new projects when clients call, assign technicians based on availability, and adjust schedules when weather delays work. But you can't give them system access without also giving them visibility into everyone's pay rates and company profitability.

**Example:** Your most trusted supervisor handles the entire North Shore territory. When clients call for quotes or want to start work, he has to call you to create the project in the system. This creates a bottleneck—you're stuck in meetings or on another call, and the client has to wait hours for a simple project setup that your supervisor could do in 2 minutes if he had access.

**Solution:** Grant supervisors project creation and management permissions without financial data access. They can create projects, assign employees, manage schedules, and respond to resident feedback—all while hourly rates, labor costs, and profit margins remain visible only to owners and operations managers.

**Benefit:** Eliminate bottlenecks. Supervisors handle day-to-day operations independently. You focus on strategic work instead of being interrupted for routine tasks. Response time to clients improves from hours to minutes.

#### For Building Managers & Property Managers

**Problem: "Administrative burden from tenant turnover - we change building managers every 6-12 months"**

Your property management company manages 40 buildings across three cities. Building managers turnover every 6-12 months. Every time someone leaves, you need to contact every vendor (rope access, HVAC, electrical, landscaping, security) to deactivate the old manager's account and create a new one. This coordination takes 2-3 days per manager change, and often old managers retain access for weeks because vendors are slow to respond.

**Example:** Sarah managed Tower One for 8 months then transferred to another building. Mike takes over. You send emails to 12 different vendors requesting account changes. Only 4 respond within a week. Three weeks later, Sarah still has access to Tower One's maintenance portal and Mike is calling you asking why he can't log in. You're sending follow-up emails and making phone calls to chase down vendors.

**Solution:** Building-level accounts eliminate individual manager account management. Each building has one permanent account (e.g., "Tower One Manager"). When managers change, your property management company updates the password in your internal system—access instantly transfers to the new manager. No vendor coordination required.

**Benefit:** Manager transitions take 30 seconds instead of 3 days. Zero vendor coordination required. No risk of former managers retaining access. No gaps where new managers can't access vendor systems.

**Problem: "Residents calling constantly during maintenance work - 300% call spike"**

During window cleaning season (May-September), your office phone never stops ringing. "When are they coming to my side of the building?" "Did they do my floor yet?" "Why are there streaks on my windows?" Your administrative staff spends 15-20 hours per week just answering progress questions, pulling them away from lease renewals, maintenance coordination, and other higher-value work.

**Example:** It's Wednesday morning during a 2-week window cleaning project at Pacific Heights Tower. You've received 47 calls since Monday asking about progress. Your admin is on call #48: "When will they do the west side?" She doesn't know—she has to call the maintenance company, wait for a callback, then call the resident back. This one question consumed 25 minutes and three phone calls.

**Solution:** Resident portal gives building occupants real-time visibility into maintenance progress. They see the 4-elevation building visualization showing exactly which sides are complete (North 100%, East 75%, South 20%, West 0%), view progress photos uploaded by technicians, and check the project schedule showing expected completion dates.

**Benefit:** Reduce resident calls by 60-70% during maintenance periods. Administrative staff freed from answering repetitive status questions. Residents get instant answers 24/7 without calling. Happier residents who feel informed and respected.

**Problem: "Complaints escalating to building managers instead of going to the vendor"**

Residents encounter issues during maintenance work: missed windows, water damage from cleaning, scheduling conflicts. But there's no direct way to report these to the maintenance company. So residents call you, the building manager. You become the middleman—taking complaints, calling the vendor, relaying information back and forth. You're spending hours on coordination that shouldn't involve you.

**Example:** Mrs. Chen in Unit 2304 emails you photos of streaky windows after the cleaning crew left. You forward the email to the rope access company. Three days pass with no response. Mrs. Chen emails you again asking for an update. You call the company, leave a voicemail. Two days later you get a callback saying they'll look into it. Meanwhile, Mrs. Chen is filing strata council complaints about management responsiveness—but it's not your fault, it's the vendor's lack of direct communication.

**Solution:** Centralized feedback system with building-level visibility. Residents submit feedback directly to the maintenance company through the portal with photos and detailed descriptions. Building managers see all feedback for their buildings in real-time, can track response times, and verify resolution—without being the middleman for every issue.

**Benefit:** Zero complaints lost in email chains. You see all resident feedback and vendor responses in one place without handling every back-and-forth. Average resolution time drops from 3-5 days to 24 hours. Documented proof of vendor responsiveness for strata councils.

---

**Problem: "Building managers don't see your value - looking unprofessional with scattered communication"**

Your maintenance vendors communicate through whatever channel is convenient: text messages, personal emails, phone calls, sticky notes left in the lobby. When you need to compile a report for the strata council or justify a contract renewal, you're digging through months of texts and emails trying to prove the work was done properly and issues were addressed promptly.

**Example:** The strata council questions why they should renew the rope access contract. "How do we know they're responsive to resident concerns?" You remember several complaints were resolved quickly, but you're scrolling through text messages from March, checking your email for attachments, and trying to remember which issues were resolved when. You can't provide concrete data, just vague assurances that "they're usually pretty good."

**Solution:** Professional vendor portal provides building managers with complete visibility: real-time project progress, comprehensive photo galleries documenting work completion, all resident feedback with response times tracked, complete work history, and downloadable reports for council presentations.

**Benefit:** Answer council questions with data, not vague memories. Generate professional reports in 2 minutes instead of 2 hours of digging through communications. Demonstrate vendor performance objectively. Justify contract renewals with documented responsiveness and quality.

#### For Building Residents

**Problem: "70% more service calls than necessary - no transparency into work progress"**

You see maintenance equipment on the roof. Scaffolding goes up on the building's west side. You have no idea what's being done, when it will be done, or if it will affect your unit. So you call the building manager to ask. So does everyone else in your building. The building manager's office is overwhelmed with calls that wouldn't be necessary if residents simply knew what was happening.

**Example:** You're in Unit 1847 on the east side of the building. Monday morning you see rope access technicians on the west side. Are they coming to your side? Today? This week? Next month? You need to know because you have plants on your exterior balcony that need to be moved before cleaning. You call the building manager. They don't know—they have to contact the vendor and call you back. Two days later you still haven't heard back, so you call again.

**Solution:** Resident portal shows your building's project in real-time. You see the 4-elevation visualization: West 100% complete, North 60% complete, East 0% (not started), South 0% (not started). Schedule shows east elevation starting Wednesday. You move your plants Tuesday night. No phone calls necessary.

**Benefit:** Plan your schedule around maintenance work. Know exactly when work will affect your unit. No calling and waiting for information. No surprises. Reduced stress and frustration.

---

**Problem: "No record of complaint resolution - submit complaint and hear nothing back"**

You notice streaks on your windows after the cleaning crew left. You email the building manager with photos. Days pass with no acknowledgment. A week later, you email again. No response. You don't know if anyone saw your complaint, if it's being addressed, or if you should just give up and clean the windows yourself.

**Example:** Your exterior windows have water damage stains after pressure washing. You email photos to the building manager on Monday. By Friday you've heard nothing. You call and leave a voicemail. The following Tuesday you send another email. Wednesday you finally get a call: "Oh sorry, I forwarded that to the contractor last week, I think they're planning to come back." No timeline, no confirmation, no accountability.

**Solution:** Submit feedback directly through the portal with photos. System timestamps your submission immediately. You see status change from "Open" to "In Progress" when management acknowledges the issue. You see public responses from the management team explaining resolution timeline. You see status change to "Closed" when fixed, with photos of corrected work.

**Benefit:** Know your concern was received immediately. See progress on resolution in real-time. Hold management accountable with transparent tracking. Average resolution time 24 hours vs. 3-5 days with traditional communication. No repeated emails or phone calls necessary.

---

**Problem: "Residents complaining to building managers instead of maintenance company - 3-day resolution times from phone tag"**

The maintenance company needs to know about issues immediately to fix them quickly. But the communication chain is broken: resident → building manager → maintenance company → back to building manager → back to resident. Each handoff adds 12-24 hours of delay. A problem that could be resolved in 4 hours takes 3 days because of communication friction.

**Example:** Unit 3205 has a broken window screen after rope access work. Resident emails building manager Tuesday morning. Manager forwards to maintenance company Tuesday afternoon. Maintenance company sees the email Wednesday and schedules repair for Thursday. Building manager doesn't know it's scheduled until Thursday morning when the technician arrives. Resident isn't home Thursday because nobody told them someone was coming. Repair finally happens Friday—3 days after initial report for a 15-minute fix.

**Solution:** Direct resident-to-vendor feedback system cuts out the middleman while keeping building managers informed. Resident submits issue Tuesday 9am. Maintenance company sees it Tuesday 9:05am, responds Tuesday 10am: "Scheduling for tomorrow 2pm." Building manager sees this entire exchange in their dashboard but doesn't handle any of the back-and-forth. Issue resolved Wednesday 2pm.

**Benefit:** 3-day resolution becomes 24-hour resolution. Building managers stay informed without handling every message. Maintenance companies respond faster because they see issues immediately. Residents get direct communication with the people who can actually fix problems.

#### Security & Data Protection

**Problem: "Multi-tenant data isolation - can't afford data breaches or leaks between companies"**

You're a small rope access company. You can't afford enterprise-grade IT security or data protection infrastructure. But you handle sensitive information: employee social insurance numbers, hourly rates, client billing data, building access codes, resident complaints. A data breach could destroy your business through lost client trust, regulatory penalties, and competitive disadvantage if competitors accessed your pricing.

**Example:** You're evaluating a construction software platform. Their security documentation is vague. You ask: "If I use your platform, can other companies see my data?" The answer is concerning: "Our system uses role-based permissions so only authorized users can access data." That doesn't answer the question—are other companies even in the same database? Could a security flaw expose your employee rates to competitors?

**Solution:** Complete multi-tenant isolation architecture. Your company's projects, employees, work sessions, photos, complaints, and financial data exist in a completely separate partition from every other company. A security flaw in another company's account cannot expose your data. Database queries are automatically scoped to your company ID—even system administrators cannot access your data without explicit audit-logged access.

**Benefit:** Bank-level data protection without hiring security experts. Guarantee to clients that their building information and resident data is isolated. Protect competitive advantages (pricing strategies, productivity rates, client relationships). Regulatory compliance for privacy laws. Sleep confidently knowing your data is protected by enterprise security architecture.

**Problem: "Password security - can't control how employees manage passwords"**

You require employees to create strong passwords, but you have no way to enforce it. Technicians use "password123" or their birthdate. When someone leaves the company, you change their password to disable access—but if they wrote it down or the database is breached, their old password might still work on other systems where they used the same password.

**Example:** You hire a new technician. He creates his account with password "Rope2024". Six months later he leaves to work for a competitor. You disable his account, but his password was stored in plain text in the database. If the competitor hires a hacker to breach your system (extreme scenario but possible), they could retrieve actual passwords and try them on your email system, accounting software, and other platforms where employees often reuse passwords.

**Solution:** Industry-standard bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds. Passwords are never stored in plain text—not even you can see them. When an employee logs in, their entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. Even if someone gained database access, they would see only irreversible hashes: `$2b$10$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXe`. Cracking these would take thousands of years with current computing power.

**Benefit:** Protect employee accounts even if database is compromised. Meet security requirements for client contracts and insurance audits. Demonstrate professional security practices. Prevent password reuse vulnerabilities. Eliminate "I forgot my password and need you to tell me what it is" requests—you literally cannot retrieve passwords, only reset them.
