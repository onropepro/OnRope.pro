## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Solution-aware (they know scheduling software exists but haven't found one built for rope access that connects to their projects)

**Core Insight:** Scheduling chaos in rope access isn't about forgetfulness. It's about juggling disconnected tools that don't talk to each other. Create a project here, recreate it in Float, text assignments to your supervisor, update the whiteboard. Same information, four places. Something always falls out of sync.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Loss Aversion:** Protect contracts from first-day no-shows. Prevent the $30K annual contract loss that one scheduling mistake causes.
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** One system, one truth. Projects and schedules connected automatically.
3. **Autonomy:** Give managers visual control without constant firefighting.
4. **Fear/Protection:** Safety compliance (no solo work from pulled techs), professional reputation with building managers.

**Emotional Territory:** Relief from Monday chaos. Professional control. Peace of mind knowing the system catches your Friday afternoon mistakes before they become Monday morning disasters.

**Primary Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) with Loss Aversion lead

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**The Monday Morning Disaster Nobody Planned**

### Body Copy

Friday afternoon. Golf tournament in an hour. You're throwing names right, left, and center to fill the spots for next week. Monday morning at 6am, your phone rings. Jack needs you to pull someone from one building, grab rope from the shop because it's not long enough for another building, and get a different tech to a third site with his gear.

Your whole week is ruined before breakfast.

This happens because your project lives in one place, your calendar lives in another, and crew assignments live in a text thread. You create the window washing project. Then you open Float and recreate it. Name the project. Block the dates. Assign employees. Tag a color. Project gets pushed five days? Update both systems. Or forget to update one. And then watch the dominoes fall.

OnRopePro connects your projects directly to your schedule. Create a project with dates and assigned crew. The calendar populates automatically. Change the project dates and the schedule updates. Try to assign someone who's already booked elsewhere and the system warns you before you create the conflict.

No more "Oh shit, I forgot to schedule that" emergencies.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header
**What This Module Does**

### Subheadline
Visual scheduling with automatic conflict prevention, connected directly to your projects.

### Intro Copy
The Scheduling and Calendar module provides dual calendar views for project assignments and employee availability, with integrated time-off management. Every assignment runs through conflict detection. Every approved vacation blocks scheduling automatically.

### Card 1: Automatic Conflict Detection
The system checks three conditions before allowing any assignment: existing project assignments, approved time-off requests, and date overlaps. If any condition fails, you see a warning with full details before you can proceed.

**What gets prevented:**
- Double-booking technicians on overlapping projects
- Scheduling employees during approved vacation
- Assigning crew to conflicting date ranges
- Friday afternoon mistakes becoming Monday disasters

### Card 2: Dual Calendar Views
Two views working together give you complete visibility. Project Calendar shows all jobs on a timeline with color-coded blocks. Resource Timeline shows employee workloads by row so you can see who's available and who's overloaded at a glance.

**What you see:**
- All upcoming projects (even unassigned ones)
- Each employee's schedule on a single row
- Availability gaps between assignments
- Time-off displayed inline with work

### Card 3: Project-Integrated Scheduling
Create a project with date range and assigned employees. The schedule populates automatically. Change the project and the schedule updates. No duplicate data entry. No systems falling out of sync.

**What stays connected:**
- Project dates flow to calendar entries
- Employee assignments appear in both views
- Changes propagate automatically
- One source of truth for project and schedule

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Company Owners

**Monday mornings without disaster calls.** The system catches Friday afternoon mistakes before they become Monday morning emergencies. Automatic conflict detection prevents the double-booking that triggers phone calls at 6am.

**Protect your contract renewals.** First-day no-shows kill contract renewals. Visual scheduling ensures your most important days are properly staffed. The $30,000 annual contract you protect pays for the software many times over.

**End the culture of disorganization.** When scheduling works, everything else works better. Professional culture. Calm mornings. Reduced stress throughout the organization.

### For Operations Managers and Supervisors

**See your entire crew at a glance.** Resource Timeline shows each employee on a single row. Spot availability gaps before they become coverage emergencies. Balance workloads to prevent burnout.

**Stop the detective work.** When a building manager asks "Can you take this new project next week?" you answer with confidence. You see exactly who's available without 20 minutes of checking spreadsheets and text threads.

**Drag and drop with protection.** Select employee, drag to project, confirm dates. The system highlights valid drop zones and warns on conflicts. Fast scheduling with automatic safeguards.

### For Technicians

**Know where you're going before Monday.** Permission-based schedule visibility lets you see your upcoming assignments through the app. No more waiting until Monday morning to find out your location.

**Schedule changes reach you.** When your assignment changes, the updated schedule is visible immediately. Fewer wasted trips to the wrong building.

### For Building Managers

**Your crews show up when scheduled.** Conflict prevention and visual scheduling help rope access companies ensure first days are properly staffed. Fewer no-shows mean fewer embarrassing calls to residents.

**Instant answers to schedule questions.** "Is your crew on-site today?" The company owner can answer immediately because they see exactly which buildings have crews scheduled.

### For Property Managers

**Reliable contractor coordination.** When the rope access company confirms a start date, you can trust that their crew scheduling actually supports it. Professional operations use professional systems.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Company Owners

**"Next thing you know, Dave is booked at two places to start two new projects on Monday."**

Friday afternoon rushing to fill spots for next week. Golf tournament in an hour. You're throwing names right, left, center. Dave gets booked on two jobs starting the same day. You don't catch it until Sunday night when you're reviewing the schedule. Now you have to call your ops manager during his family barbecue to change everything.

Automatic conflict detection prevents the double-booking in the first place. The moment you try to assign Dave to a second project on the same day, the system displays a warning with details about his existing assignment. The conflict cannot be created accidentally.

**"You don't show up on the first day, especially on a new contract. It's just bad news all around."**

The property manager is waiting. Building manager has keys ready. Residents got notices in the elevator two weeks ago. Everyone expects you on December 15th. Double-booking means pulling people from other buildings to cover. Now you're behind everywhere. Techs working alone (safety violation). And the client who was waiting? They remember.

Visual calendar shows all project start dates with assigned technicians. Resource Timeline reveals if critical first days are understaffed. You can see at a glance whether your most important days are properly covered. The contract renewal you protect pays for the software.

**"A guy would book two weeks vacation and then Jeff would just forget and book him at a building."**

Approved vacation sitting in an email or a text. Then forgotten when scheduling next week. Monday morning: "Where's Dave?" "He's in Mexico." Pull people from other buildings. Again.

Approved time-off automatically blocks scheduling for those dates. When you try to assign someone on approved vacation, the system displays a conflict warning. The employee appears as unavailable in the drag-and-drop panel. The vacation you approved two months ago still protects that employee from being scheduled.

### For Operations Managers

**"I had to go from project to project and look at the guys on the rope and take notes of where they're at compared to yesterday."**

No single view of crew workload. Some techs overworked, others sitting idle. You don't know until you're physically visiting each site. Imbalanced assignments burn out your best people.

Resource Timeline shows each employee's schedule on a single row. See who's booked solid versus who has gaps. Make proactive decisions about workload distribution before anyone gets burned out.

### For Technicians

**"They would be told on Monday, go to this address. You go to this address."**

No visibility into your own schedule. You find out Monday morning where you're supposed to be. Hard to plan your week. Hard to plan your life.

Permission-based schedule visibility. If the employer enables it, you see your upcoming assignments through the app. You know where you're going before Monday. Changes are visible immediately.

### For Building Managers

**"You don't show up on the first day where everybody's waiting for you. It's just bad news all around."**

You prepared for the rope access crew. Notices went to residents. Keys are ready. Access arranged. They don't show up. Your phone starts ringing. Angry residents. You look incompetent to your board.

OnRopePro's conflict prevention helps rope access companies ensure first days are properly staffed. Professional systems create reliable contractors. Your reputation protected.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header
**Stop Fighting Fires. Start Running a Business.**

### Body Copy

Right now, scheduling consumes hours of your week. Create the project. Open Float. Recreate it. Text crew assignments. Update the whiteboard. Check for conflicts manually. Hope nothing slips through.

When something does slip through, you spend Monday morning in crisis mode. Calling techs. Pulling people from other buildings. Apologizing to building managers. Explaining to clients why your crew didn't show up when you said they would.

With OnRopePro, you create a project and assign the crew. The calendar populates. You drag an employee to a new project and the system warns you if they're already booked. You approve vacation two months ago and the system still blocks scheduling for those dates.

Monday mornings become boring. The phone doesn't ring at 6am. Your ops manager enjoys his Sunday barbecue. Your crews show up where they're supposed to. Building managers see you as the professional operation you actually are.

That's what it looks like when scheduling just works.

## 10. FAQs

**Can technicians see their own schedule?**
Yes, if you enable the permission. Company owners control whether technicians can view their own upcoming assignments. You can also enable viewing the full team schedule for supervisors and managers.

**What happens if I try to assign someone who's on vacation?**
The system displays a conflict warning showing the approved time-off dates. You see the warning before the assignment is created. You can override if necessary, but you cannot accidentally schedule someone during approved vacation.

**Can I still make scheduling decisions if there's a conflict?**
Yes. Conflict warnings display details and give you the option to proceed or cancel. The system prevents accidents, not decisions. You remain in control.

**How does the calendar connect to projects?**
When you create a project with date range and assigned employees, calendar entries generate automatically. Change the project dates and the calendar updates. One system, one truth.

**What time-off types are supported?**
10 leave types: vacation, sick leave, personal leave, bereavement, jury duty, medical leave, family emergency, unpaid leave, training/development, and military leave. Each displays distinctly on the calendar.

**Can I see both projects and employees in one view?**
The dual calendar system provides two complementary views. Project Calendar shows all jobs on a timeline. Resource Timeline shows employee workloads by row. Use both together for complete visibility.

**How does drag-and-drop work?**
Select an employee from the panel. Drag onto the project calendar at the desired date. System highlights valid drop zones. Confirm date range in the popup. Assignment created with automatic conflict checking.

**What if someone calls in sick last minute?**
You can update their status to sick leave for the current day. The Resource Timeline immediately shows them as unavailable. You can then see who's available to cover based on their current assignments.

**Does the schedule sync with Google Calendar or Outlook?**
OnRopePro maintains its own scheduling system connected to your projects. The integration is designed to keep project management and scheduling unified within one platform.

**Who can approve time-off requests?**
Managers with the appropriate permission can approve or deny time-off requests. Approvals automatically add the time-off to the calendar and block scheduling. Denials notify the employee with reason.
