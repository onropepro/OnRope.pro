## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**The Quoting Problem That's Bleeding You Dry**

### Body Copy

You send your tech to assess a complex. Four towers, different elevations, mixed services. He comes back with hand-scribbled notes on drop counts. You pull out your calculator, multiply hours by rates, add service fees, double-check the math. 

An hour later, you realize you forgot Tower C. Your quote is low by $2,400. You either eat the loss or look incompetent renegotiating.

Meanwhile, your competitor sent their quote three hours ago. From their phone. With professional formatting. Your property manager already replied to them.

OnRopePro eliminates quote calculation errors, protects your pricing strategy from employee exposure, and turns site assessments into professional proposals while your tech is still on-site. Your pricing stays private. Your quotes stay accurate. Your closing rate stops hemorrhaging to faster competitors.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header
**Quote Creation That Protects Your Numbers While Accelerating Your Sales**

### Intro Copy
The Quoting & Sales Pipeline module creates service-specific quotes with automatic labor calculations while maintaining complete financial privacy through granular permission controls, then tracks every opportunity through your sales process from first contact to won contract.

### Card 1: Service-Specific Pricing Models
**Automatic calculations matched to how you actually price jobs.** Window cleaning quotes calculate from drops per elevation and daily targets. Parkade quotes multiply stall counts by your per-stall rate. Dryer vent jobs price per unit or hourly. Painting prices per drop. Each service type has its own formula so your labor costs calculate correctly every single time without pulling out a calculator.

**What gets calculated automatically:**
- Window/building wash: hours from drops per elevation and daily targets
- Parkade cleaning: total stalls multiplied by price per stall
- Dryer vent: unit count or hourly rate pricing
- Painting: drop count multiplied by per-drop rate
- Ground windows: estimated hours times hourly rate
- Custom services: configurable pricing models

### Card 2: Financial Privacy Controls
**Your technicians gather site data without seeing what you charge.** Financial Access permission determines who sees pricing information. Tech creates the quote, enters building details, counts drops, takes elevation photos. All pricing fields stay hidden. You open the quote later, enter your rates, generate the professional PDF. Your pricing strategy stays between you and your property managers.

**What stays protected:**
- Hourly rates by service type
- Per-drop pricing for window and painting work
- Per-stall rates for parkade jobs
- Total quote values and profit margins
- Historical pricing data across all quotes
- Service fee structures and add-ons

### Card 3: Visual Sales Pipeline
**Kanban board that shows exactly where every opportunity stands.** Drag quotes from Draft to Submitted to Under Review to Negotiation to Won or Lost. Pipeline calculates total opportunity value per stage. You see win rates, conversion metrics, and revenue forecasting. No more forgotten follow-ups or lost opportunities buried in email threads.

**What gets tracked:**
- Current stage for every quote in your pipeline
- Total dollar value of opportunities per stage
- Win rate percentages and conversion metrics
- How long quotes spend in each stage
- Revenue forecasts based on pipeline value
- Historical performance trends over time

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Your techs can't see your pricing, but they can build your quotes.** Send anyone to assess a building. They capture drop counts, take photos, enter floor details, select service types. Financial Access permission hides all pricing fields from their view. You keep pricing strategy private while leveraging your entire team for site assessments and quote generation.

**Calculator errors cost you thousands per year.** You quote 120 drops at 30 drops per day, calculate 4 days times 8 hours, multiply by $75 per hour. You get $2,400. Except you forgot to add the service fee. Or you miscounted Tower B's drops. Or you used last year's rate by mistake. Service-specific formulas eliminate manual calculation errors that lose contracts or eat profit margins.

**Professional quotes close faster than handwritten estimates.** Property managers compare you to competitors. Your PDF quote shows itemized services, building-specific details, professional formatting, your company branding. Their handwritten estimate shows chicken scratch on lined paper. You win the contract because you looked like the professional operation you actually are.

**One-click conversion from won quote to active project.** Quote gets accepted. Instead of re-entering building address, service details, and pricing into your project system, you click Convert to Project. All data transfers automatically. Budget hours, building location, service specifications, client contact information. Zero double-entry, zero transcription errors, zero wasted time.

**Pipeline visibility stops opportunities from falling through cracks.** How many quotes did you send last month? Which ones are still pending? Who needs a follow-up call? Visual Kanban board answers these instantly. Drag quote cards between stages as conversations progress. Never forget to follow up. Never lose track of a potential contract. Win rates increase when nothing slips through.

### For Technicians

**Capture building details without financial pressure.** You assess the site, count drops per elevation, photograph each building face, note special access requirements. Pricing fields don't even appear in your interface. No awkward conversations with property managers about costs. No accidentally quoting the wrong rate. You focus on accurate site assessment while the system handles quote generation.

**Your phone becomes your site assessment tool.** Building data entry works perfectly on mobile. Take photos directly from the quote form. GPS auto-fills building address. Drop-down menus eliminate typos. Submit the complete assessment before you leave the parking lot. No paper notes that get lost. No "I'll enter it later" that becomes "I forgot the details."

**Build your professional identity with quality work.** Creating accurate, detailed quotes demonstrates competence. Property managers remember technicians who show up prepared, document thoroughly, communicate professionally. Your reputation builds with every thorough assessment you submit, even though you never see the final pricing.

### For Building Managers

**Receive itemized quotes that justify your decision.** Quote PDF shows exactly what you're paying for. Window cleaning breaks down by elevation, drop count, and estimated days. Parkade shows total stalls being cleaned. Dryer vent lists unit count or hourly estimate. When your strata council or board asks why you chose this vendor, you show professional documentation instead of vague "they seemed good" explanations.

**Compare vendors on actual specifics, not just price.** Three companies quote your complex. Company A sends a single lump sum. Company B sends an Excel spreadsheet you can't open on your phone. OnRopePro vendor sends itemized PDF showing drops per elevation, service breakdown, timeline estimate. You make informed decisions instead of guessing who actually scoped the work correctly.

**Archived quotes become maintenance history.** That window cleaning quote from 2023 shows how many drops were on each elevation before the renovation added floors. When planning future work, you reference actual historical data instead of trying to remember details or digging through email archives from three years ago.

### For Property Managers

**Professional vendors use professional systems.** Portfolio with twenty buildings. Maintenance coordinator sends you quote request. You forward to five rope access companies. Four respond with handwritten notes or basic Word docs. One sends OnRopePro quote with building-specific details, service breakdowns, professional formatting. That vendor understands operational excellence. You short-list them automatically because their quote demonstrates systematic processes.

**Audit trail for every contracted service.** Your compliance framework requires documented vendor selection rationale. OnRopePro quotes provide itemized scope, service specifications, and professional formatting that satisfy audit requirements. When insurance or board members ask why you approved this contract, you show detailed documentation instead of scrambling to reconstruct decision logic.

### For Residents

**Transparency about what work is actually happening.** Your building posts notice: "Window cleaning scheduled for March 15-18." Quote details show your tower's drop count, which elevations are being cleaned, estimated timeline. You understand the scope instead of vague "maintenance work" announcements that create uncertainty about noise, access, or duration.

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy
Every feature serves a single purpose: eliminate quote errors, protect financial data, and accelerate your sales process from first contact to signed contract.

### Feature 1: Service-Specific Pricing Formulas
**Automatic labor calculations matched to how you actually price each service type.** Window cleaning calculates hours from drops per elevation and your daily target productivity rate. Parkade pricing multiplies total stalls by your per-stall rate. Dryer vent switches between per-unit and hourly pricing models. Each service type uses its own formula so labor costs calculate correctly without manual multiplication errors or forgotten variables.

### Feature 2: Multi-Building Tower Support
**Quote complexes with Tower A, Tower B, Tower C configurations.** Some condos have multiple buildings under one strata. Each tower has different floor counts, drop counts, and pricing. Add buildings with separate elevations, separate drop calculations, separate timelines. Work sessions let technicians select which tower they're working on. Resident portal shows tower-specific updates. Quote accurately for multi-building complexes without creating separate quotes per tower.

### Feature 3: Granular Financial Permissions
**Control exactly who sees pricing information with Financial Access permission.** Technicians create quotes and capture site details without pricing fields even appearing in their interface. Operations managers review project budgets without seeing individual pay rates. Only users with explicit Financial Access permission view rates, totals, and profit margins. Protect sensitive pricing strategy from exposure to staff who don't need financial visibility.

### Feature 4: Visual Sales Pipeline
**Kanban board showing Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Negotiation, Won, and Lost stages.** Drag quote cards between columns as conversations progress. Pipeline automatically calculates total opportunity value per stage. Track how long quotes spend in each stage. Monitor win rates and conversion percentages. Forecast revenue based on pipeline value and historical close rates. Never lose track of a potential contract or forget to follow up.

### Feature 5: Building Photo Attachments
**Technicians photograph each elevation during site assessment.** Photos attach directly to quote for your review. See what your tech saw when they counted drops. Verify access points, rigging locations, and potential complications before finalizing pricing. Reference photos when project starts to confirm scope matches assessment. Visual documentation eliminates "that's not what I thought it looked like" surprises.

### Feature 6: One-Click Project Conversion
**Won quote becomes active project with single button press.** Quote gets accepted. Click Convert to Project. Building address, service details, budget hours, client contact information, tower configurations, pricing data transfers automatically. Project starts with complete historical context. Zero double-entry. Zero transcription errors. Seamless transition from sales to operations.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"I sent my new tech to quote a building. He came back with the client's budget expectations and quoted below our minimum margin."**

You need people gathering site data. The moment they have quoting access, they see your pricing strategy. Your tech tells the property manager "usually runs about $X per drop" based on what he saw in the system. Property manager uses that to negotiate you down. Your margin compresses before you even submit the official quote.

Financial Access permission separates site assessment from pricing visibility. Technician enters drops, elevations, building details, photos. Pricing fields don't exist in his interface. You set rates after assessment is complete. Your pricing strategy stays private until you're ready to present the formal quote.

**"I quoted a complex at $4,800. After we started, I realized I forgot Tower C in my calculations. We did $6,200 of work for $4,800."**

Four towers, different elevations, varying drop counts per elevation. You're calculating on your phone between site visits. Drop counts from Tower A, multiply by your rate, add Tower B, multiply by different elevation multiplier. Your notes say "Tower C: same as Tower A" but Tower C actually has 40% more drops. You discover the error after the contract is signed.

Service-specific formulas eliminate manual calculation errors. Enter drops per elevation for each tower. System calculates total hours from drops and your daily productivity target. Add pricing multipliers. Quote total updates automatically. No calculator errors, no forgotten buildings, no surprise losses when you realize your math was wrong.

**"Property manager chose my competitor because they sent their quote three hours after the site visit. Mine took two days."**

Your tech assesses the building Tuesday morning. Takes notes on paper. Texts you drop counts. You enter data into spreadsheet that night. Create PDF Wednesday afternoon. Email it Thursday morning. Property manager already signed with the company that sent their quote Tuesday at 2pm.

Mobile quote creation eliminates the assessment-to-quote delay. Technician completes site assessment on phone. Building data, drop counts, photos all captured in the quote form. You open the quote on desktop, add pricing, generate PDF, send. Same-day quote delivery becomes standard instead of exceptional.

**"I have twelve quotes in various stages but no idea which ones are actually moving forward."**

Draft folder has quotes from three months ago you never finished. Sent folder has quotes you're waiting to hear back on, but you forgot which ones. Email searches try to find that conversation with the property manager about the negotiation, but it's buried in 400 unread messages. You lose track of real opportunities while busy creating new quotes.

Visual pipeline shows exactly where every quote stands. Submitted stage shows quotes waiting for client response. Under Review stage shows active negotiations. Track total opportunity value per stage. Set reminders for follow-ups. Dashboard shows quotes that have been in one stage too long. Pipeline visibility prevents lost opportunities and forgotten follow-ups.

**"My competitor's quotes look professional with company branding. Mine look like everyone else's basic PDF."**

Generic quote template with standard fonts. No logo. No company colors. Property managers receive five quotes for their building. Four look identical. One has professional branding, clean layout, itemized services with clear explanations. That vendor gets remembered. That vendor gets callbacks. That vendor builds reputation as the premium operator.

White-label branding customizes your quote PDFs with your logo, company colors, and professional formatting. Property managers see your brand identity on every document. Professional presentation reinforces premium positioning. Your quotes stand out in the pile of generic submissions from competitors still using default templates.

### For Technicians

**"Boss asks me to quote buildings but gets mad when I mention pricing to property managers."**

You assess the building. Property manager asks "about how much for window cleaning?" You saw the rate in the system last week. You say "probably around $X per drop." Boss finds out you discussed pricing. You get lectured about "letting him handle that part." Except you're the one talking to the client.

Financial Access permission removes pricing visibility from technician interface. You can't accidentally quote rates because you've never seen them. Property manager asks about pricing. You confidently say "my manager will send detailed pricing today" because that's your actual workflow. No awkward trying-to-remember-if-you're-allowed-to-say conversations.

**"I photograph buildings on my phone but then forget to send them when I'm back in the truck."**

Elevation photos on camera roll. Drop count notes in phone notepad. Building address in text message to yourself. Get back to shop. Boss asks for the assessment. You text him the photos. He asks for drop counts. You send that separately. He asks for building address. You look it up again. Information scattered across multiple apps, multiple messages, multiple headaches.

Quote form accepts photos directly from phone camera. Building address auto-fills from GPS. Drop counts enter in structured fields with elevation labels. Everything lives in one quote record. Submit from parking lot before leaving site. Complete assessment delivered to manager while building details are fresh in your memory.

### For Building Managers

**"I approved a window cleaning quote, then discovered they only quoted two towers out of four."**

Vendor submitted lump sum quote: "Window cleaning service - $3,200." You approved it. Work started. Crew only brought enough supplies for half the complex. Vendor explains "the quote only covered the north towers." Nothing in the quote specified which buildings. Your fault for not asking. Their fault for not clarifying. Everyone frustrated.

OnRopePro quotes break down work by specific towers. Quote shows Tower A: 80 drops, Tower B: 95 drops, Tower C: 75 drops, Tower D: 90 drops. Total drop count listed. Each elevation itemized. Before approving, you verify all buildings are included in scope. No surprises on work day about what's covered versus what costs extra.

**"Vendor quoted my building last year but I can't find the email to reference the scope."**

Planning this year's window cleaning. Last year's vendor did good work. You want the same scope and service. Email search for last year's quote returns seventeen unrelated messages. Eventually find it attached to a forwarded message in a thread about a different building. Quote shows a single price. No breakdown of what was actually included.

OnRopePro vendors' historical quotes stay in the system with building association. Next year, vendor references last year's quote. Sees same drop counts, same elevations, same service breakdown. Updates pricing for current year. You compare quotes year-over-year to verify scope consistency. Historical data accessible without email archaeology.

### For Property Managers

**"I can't justify vendor selection to the board because quotes don't show enough detail."**

Board meeting agenda: approve window cleaning contract. You selected Vendor B at $8,400 over Vendor A at $7,200. Board member asks "why are we paying $1,200 more?" Vendor B's quote says "Window cleaning - $8,400." Vendor A's quote says "Window cleaning - $7,200." You explain "Vendor B is more professional" but have zero documentation supporting that statement.

OnRopePro quotes provide itemized scope justifying price differences. Vendor B quote shows 340 total drops across four elevations, 8-day timeline, includes parkade pressure washing. Vendor A quote shows single lump sum. Board member reviews detailed breakdown. Asks "did Vendor A quote parkade washing?" Answer: unknown, their quote doesn't specify. Vendor B approval becomes defensible decision based on documented scope.

## 7. Measurable Results

### Time Savings
Quote generation time drops from 45-90 minutes of manual calculation to 5-10 minutes of data entry with automatic labor calculations. Your operations manager creates four detailed quotes in the time it previously took to calculate one. Same-day quote delivery becomes standard operating procedure instead of "as soon as I can get to it."

### Error Reduction
Manual calculation errors that create 10-15% quote variations disappear completely. Service-specific formulas eliminate multiply-by-wrong-rate mistakes, forgotten elevation multipliers, and miscounted tower calculations. Your quotes stay accurate because math happens automatically based on validated pricing formulas.

### Privacy Protection
Financial Access permission prevents pricing exposure to technicians, operations managers, and administrative staff who don't need financial visibility. Pay rate confidentiality maintains staff morale while allowing operational delegation. Pricing strategy stays protected from competitors when employees move between companies.

### Win Rate Improvement
Professional presentation, same-day delivery, and itemized scope breakdowns differentiate you from competitors still using calculators and Word docs. Property managers remember vendors who demonstrate systematic operations through professional quote formatting. Your close rate improves when every quote showcases operational excellence.

## 8. Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy
Quoting integrates with four other modules to create seamless workflow from first site assessment through project completion and resident communication.

### Project Management
Won quotes convert to active projects with single click. Building address, service specifications, budget hours, client contact details, tower configurations transfer automatically. Project starts with complete context from original quote. Budget tracking compares actual hours against quoted labor estimates. Historical quotes inform future project planning.

### Work Sessions & Time Tracking
Multi-building quotes with tower configurations enable tower-specific time tracking. Technicians clock in and select which tower they're working on. Work session data accumulates per-tower hours for accurate progress tracking and client invoicing. Quote scope matches work session structure for perfect alignment.

### Resident Portal
Building associations from quotes enable tower-specific resident notifications. Residents see updates about work happening on their specific tower within multi-building complex. Quote scope informs work notices with accurate service descriptions and timeline estimates. Professional communication from quote through completion.

### Employee Management
Financial Access permission controls quote pricing visibility. Create, View, and Edit permissions determine who can access quote module at all. Permission inheritance means operational managers can create quotes without seeing company-wide financial data. Granular controls protect sensitive information while enabling delegation.

### Analytics Dashboard
Pipeline metrics track total opportunity value per stage, win rates, conversion percentages, and revenue forecasting. Quote volume trends identify busy seasons and capacity planning needs. Win/loss analysis reveals which service types close at higher rates. Historical data informs pricing strategy and sales process optimization.

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header
**Stop Calculating. Start Closing.**

### Body Copy

You waste 6-8 hours per week on quote calculations. Multiply drop counts by rates, add elevation factors, cross-reference service fees, double-check the math. Your property manager asks about that complex you assessed Thursday. You say "I'll get you pricing by tomorrow" because tonight you're calculating quotes instead of doing literally anything else.

Your new tech asks about quoting that downtown building. You can't send him because he'd see everyone's pay rates. You drive across town yourself to count drops. Forty-five minutes each way. Two hours on-site. Three hours round-trip for a quote you could have delegated if your system protected financial data.

OnRopePro eliminates quote calculation time completely. Service-specific formulas calculate labor automatically from drop counts and productivity rates. Your tech captures site details on his phone without seeing any pricing. You open the quote later, verify his assessment, enter your rates, generate the professional PDF. Same-day quote delivery becomes your standard. Calculator apps get deleted from your phone.

You reclaim eight hours per week. Property managers remember you as the company that responds fast with professional documentation. Your close rate improves because you're not losing opportunities to competitors who quote faster. Growth stops being bottlenecked by how quickly you can calculate proposals.

## 10. FAQs

**Can technicians create quotes without seeing pricing?**
Yes. Financial Access permission controls pricing visibility completely separately from quote creation access. Technicians see fields for drops per elevation, building details, service types, and photos. Pricing fields don't appear in their interface at all. You enter rates after they submit the site assessment.

**What happens to quotes when technicians leave?**
Quote ownership transfers to their supervisor or you can reassign to another employee. Historical quotes remain in the system with building association intact. Employee departure doesn't delete quote history or building data. Permission changes instantly revoke access to active quotes.

**How do service-specific formulas work?**
Each service type has its own calculation model. Window cleaning calculates hours from drops per elevation divided by your daily productivity target. Parkade multiplies total stalls by per-stall rate. Dryer vent switches between per-unit and hourly models. You configure your rates and productivity targets once, then system calculates labor automatically for every quote.

**Can I quote multiple buildings in one quote?**
Yes. Multi-building support handles complexes with Tower A, Tower B, Tower C configurations. Each tower has separate floor counts, drop counts, and calculations. Total quote combines all towers. When converted to project, work sessions let technicians select which tower they're working on. Resident portal shows tower-specific updates.

**Do quotes automatically email to clients?**
Currently no. Quote PDFs download to your device, then you email from your own email address. Future update will enable direct sending from vendor@yourcompany.com with proper DNS configuration. Download approach ensures quotes come from your recognized email address.

**What if my pricing model doesn't match the built-in formulas?**
Custom service type allows completely configurable pricing. Define your own calculation variables, labor multipliers, and service fee structures. If you need a specific formula added as a standard service type, contact support. Formula requests from multiple vendors get prioritized for system-wide implementation.

**How does tax calculation work?**
Tax configuration will be based on building address (province/state determines rate). System calculates applicable taxes automatically. Currently being implemented. You can enter taxes manually in the interim. Future update will support dual-tax jurisdictions (GST + PST scenarios) with override capabilities for edge cases.

**Can I edit quotes after they're in "Submitted" or "Under Review"?**
Yes. Drag quote back to Draft stage, make edits, then move forward again. Edit history tracks changes for internal audit trail. Property manager only sees current version. You can't edit quotes in Won stage (convert to project instead). Lost quotes archive for historical reference.

**What permissions do operations managers need to create quotes?**
Create Quotes permission enables quote creation. Financial Access permission determines if they see pricing fields. You can grant quote creation without financial visibility. They assess buildings, create scopes, move quotes through pipeline. You review and add final pricing before client delivery.

**How do quotes convert to projects?**
Won quote stage includes "Convert to Project" button. Click button. System creates new project with building address, service details, budget hours, client contacts, tower configurations, pricing data. Quote remains in Won stage for reference. Project links back to original quote for historical context.

**Can I track win/loss reasons for pipeline analytics?**
Yes. When marking quote as Lost, you categorize reason (price too high, chose competitor, timeline didn't work, etc.). Analytics track loss reasons over time. Identify patterns like "losing 60% of quotes to faster competitors" or "price objections on parkade services." Data informs pricing strategy and process improvements.

**Do building photos increase quote file size?**
Photos compress automatically for system storage. Original quality preserved for reference viewing. Quote PDFs include photos at print-appropriate resolution without creating massive file sizes. Download speeds stay fast even with multiple elevation photos attached.

**What happens if property manager requests changes to accepted quote?**
Depends on change scope. Minor adjustments (different dates, tower sequence) you can note in project details. Significant changes (added buildings, different services) create new quote version as change order. Original quote stays in Won stage. New quote references original for audit trail.

**Can I duplicate quotes for similar buildings?**
Yes. "Duplicate Quote" function copies building template with service selections and configurations. You update building-specific details (address, drop counts, elevations). Pricing models stay identical. Useful for annual renewals or similar complexes in same area. Saves 80% of quote setup time.

**How long does pipeline data persist?**
Forever. Won and Lost quotes archive with full historical data. Reference last year's pricing when client requests renewal. Track win rates over multi-year periods. Building associations preserve maintenance history across ownership changes. Data belongs to your company permanently.
