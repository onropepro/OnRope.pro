# Replit Instructions: Property Manager Pre-Launch Landing Page

**Page URL:** `/property-manager-coming-soon` or `/pm-prelaunch`  
**Reference:** Use existing property manager portal page styling and main pre-launch page structure  
**Purpose:** Pre-launch signup page targeting property & strata managers (not employers or technicians)

---

## Audience Context

Property managers are NOT the paying customers. Employers (rope access companies) pay for the platform. Property managers get free portal access when their vendors use OnRopePro.

**Their motivations:**
- Reduce liability exposure from vendor negligence
- Stop chasing vendor insurance certificates
- Get out of the resident complaint loop
- Have data to justify vendor decisions to building owners
- Look professional and technologically sophisticated

**Their fears:**
- Being blamed when a vendor incident occurs
- Spending hours on admin instead of property management
- Not being able to prove due diligence
- Resident complaints consuming their time

---

## Design Requirements

- Match the visual style of the main pre-launch landing page (dark hero, orange accents, white content sections)
- Mobile-first, responsive design
- Use existing OnRopePro design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Professional, enterprise feel (these are B2B decision influencers)

| "I spend hours chasing vendor insurance certificates before they expire" | All certificates visible in your portal. System alerts vendors before expiration. You just verify, not chase. |
| "Residents complain to me about window washing, and I have to relay it to the vendor" | Residents submit feedback directly to vendors. You see resolution status without playing telephone. |
| "When the building owner asks how the project is going, I have to call the contractor" | Log in and check: "68% complete, ahead of schedule." Answer instantly without calling anyone. |
| "I have no data to justify why I chose one vendor over another" | CSR scores, response times, and resolution rates give you objective criteria for vendor selection and renewal decisions. |
| "If there's an accident, I can't prove I did due diligence on vendor safety" | Your portal shows documented history of CSR reviews, safety compliance monitoring, and certificate verification. Due diligence, documented. |

Yes. Rope access companies pay for OnRopePro. Property managers get free portal access when their vendors use the platform.
```

**Q: What if my current vendor doesn't use OnRopePro?**

If a vendor is on OnRopePro, you can request to view their Company Safety Rating as part of your RFP process. Vendors can share their CSR with prospective clients.
```

**Q: What data do I have access to?**
