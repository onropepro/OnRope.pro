## Hero Section

### Primary Headline

Built for the moment you realize your new hire can see everyone's rates.

### Alternative Headlines

1. Your supervisor needs system access. Not your payroll secrets.
2. Give your team the keys. Keep the safe locked.

### Subheadline

Assign project creation, scheduling, and safety compliance to the people who need it. Keep hourly rates, labor costs, and profit margins visible only to you. One system. Clear boundaries. Zero compromises.

## Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

The Access Problem Nobody Talks About

### Body Copy

Construction software wasn't built for rope access.

You add your supervisor to the system. Now they see everything. Pay rates. Profit margins. Which jobs lose money. Which technicians cost the most.

It's not about trust. Some information belongs at the owner level.

Most systems force a choice: do everything yourself and become the bottleneck, or give access and hope nobody looks where they shouldn't.

Meanwhile, building managers drown in resident calls. Technicians text complaints to personal phones. Property managers piece together vendor performance from scattered emails.

Everyone's frustrated. Nobody has the full picture.

OnRopePro separates what people can do from what they can see. Five stakeholder types. One unified system. Every person sees exactly what they need. Nothing more.

## What This Module Does

### Section Header

Complete Access Control That Creates Itself Through Daily Use

### Intro Copy

Every login, every permission, every piece of feedback flows through a single system designed for how rope access actually works.

### Card 1: Role-Based Permission Architecture

Before any employee accesses the system, you define exactly what they see. 44+ individual permissions across financial, operational, safety, and inventory categories. Your ops manager creates projects without seeing payroll. Your ground crew logs hours without accessing bids.

**What gets controlled:**
- Financial data visibility (rates, costs, margins)
- Project creation and modification rights
- Employee management capabilities
- Safety documentation access
- Inventory and equipment permissions

### Card 2: External Stakeholder Portals

Three separate portals for three different needs. Residents see their building's progress and submit feedback. Building managers see project details and response metrics. Property managers see portfolio-wide performance. No cross-contamination. No unauthorized access.

**What each portal provides:**
- Resident: Progress visibility, feedback submission, photo documentation
- Building Manager: Full project details, feedback management, work history
- Property Manager: Multi-building oversight, vendor performance metrics, exportable reports

### Card 3: Centralized Feedback System

Every resident complaint, compliment, and question flows into one dashboard. No more texts to personal phones. No more emails lost in inboxes. No more sticky notes in the lobby. Timestamped. Photographed. Tracked from open to resolved.

**What gets tracked:**
- Submission timestamp
- Acknowledgment timestamp  
- Resolution timestamp
- Photo documentation
- Response time metrics

## Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Delegate without exposure.** Your supervisor handles North Shore operations. Creates projects. Assigns crews. Manages schedules. Never sees what anyone earns. You focus on growth instead of gatekeeping.

**Protect your margins.** Client billing rates, internal costs, project profitability stay visible only to you. Your bookkeeper sees aggregate numbers. Your admin processes invoices. Nobody pieces together your competitive advantage.

**Onboard in minutes.** Create an account, assign permissions, done. No IT tickets. No back-and-forth emails. Employee sets their own password on first login.

### For Technicians

**See your work, not everyone else's.** Your assigned projects. Your logged hours. Your safety inspections. Clean interface showing exactly what you need for today's job.

**Submit feedback from the field.** Resident flags an issue while you're on rope? Log it in 30 seconds. Photos attached. Building manager notified. No more remembering to tell someone when you get back to the truck.

**Your certifications travel with you.** IRATA level tracked in your profile. When you move companies, your professional identity stays intact.

### For Building Managers

**Stop being the middleman.** Residents submit directly to the vendor. You see everything without handling every back-and-forth. When the strata council asks about responsiveness, you pull the report.

**Access survives turnover.** Building accounts, not personal accounts. When you take over from the previous manager, change the password. Instant access. No vendor coordination.

**Prove vendor performance.** Response times tracked automatically. Resolution rates calculated. Export professional reports for council presentations in two minutes.

### For Property Managers

**Portfolio-wide visibility.** Every building. Every vendor. Every open issue. One dashboard. Know which properties need attention without calling anyone.

**Manager turnover handled.** Your building managers change every 6-12 months. Building accounts mean zero access gaps. Zero former employees with lingering credentials. Zero vendor coordination.

**Compliance documentation ready.** When insurance asks about vendor safety programs, you have answers. Digital records. Timestamped inspections. Exportable proof.

### For Residents

**Know what's happening without calling.** West elevation 80% complete. East starts Wednesday. Move your balcony plants Tuesday night. No phone tag with the building manager.

**Submit issues with photos.** Streaky windows? Snap a photo. Submit through the portal. Watch status change from Open to Acknowledged to Resolved. Know someone saw it.

**Get answers faster.** Direct to vendor means 24-hour resolution instead of 3-5 days of phone tag through the building manager.

## Problems Solved

### For Employers

**"My supervisor saw everyone's pay rates on day one."**

You need your ops manager to create projects and check budgets. The moment you grant access, they see what every technician earns. Your Level 1 finds out your Level 3 lead makes $18 more per hour.

OnRopePro separates operational access from financial visibility. 44 individual permissions. Grant project creation without exposing compensation data.

**"A technician changed his own hourly rate from $32 to $42."**

He also adjusted last week's drop counts. You discovered it during payroll when the numbers didn't add up.

Permission controls restrict who can edit what. Technicians log work for assigned projects. Rates stay locked to designated managers.

**"I spend hours setting up accounts and chasing passwords."**

Create the account. Set permissions. Done. Employee sets their own password. External users register themselves with building codes. Your admin time approaches zero.

### For Technicians

**"I have to remember 10 different complaints and tell Jeff later."**

Resident flags an issue on the ground. You're heading back up the rope. By end of day, you've forgotten half of them. Two weeks later: "Did you go back to 1037?"

Log feedback from your phone in 30 seconds. Photos attached. Automatically routed. Nothing forgotten.

**"I can see way more than I need to and it's overwhelming."**

Your dashboard shows your projects. Your hours. Your inspections. Not the entire company's financials. Clean interface for the work that matters.

### For Building Managers

**"I'm forwarding emails between residents and vendors all day."**

Mrs. Chen emails you photos of streaky windows. You forward to the rope access company. Three days pass. Mrs. Chen emails again. You call the vendor. Leave a voicemail. Meanwhile, she's filing strata complaints about your responsiveness.

Direct resident-to-vendor feedback. You see everything without being in the middle. Average resolution drops from 3-5 days to 24 hours.

**"The previous manager left and I can't access anything."**

You emailed 12 vendors requesting account changes. Three weeks later, Sarah still has access and you can't log in.

Change the building password. Instant access. Sarah's locked out. No vendor coordination.

### For Property Managers

**"I manage 40 buildings and building managers turn over constantly."**

Every 6-12 months, someone leaves. You send emails to every vendor. Chase down account changes. Former managers retain access for weeks.

Building-level accounts eliminate the problem. Password change transfers access instantly.

**"The strata council asks if our vendors are responsive. I have no data."**

You remember several complaints were resolved quickly. But you're scrolling through texts from March trying to prove it.

Pull the report. Average response time: 4.2 hours. Resolution rate: 94%. Data instead of vague assurances.

### For Residents

**"I see equipment on the roof. Nobody tells me what's happening."**

Technicians on the west side Monday. Are they coming to your side? You need to move balcony plants. You call the building manager. They don't know. They call the vendor.

Check the portal. West 100% complete. East starts Wednesday. Move your plants Tuesday night. No calls.

**"I reported streaky windows three weeks ago. No idea if anyone saw it."**

Email to building manager. Forward to vendor. Lost in someone's inbox.

Submit through the portal. Status changes from Open to Acknowledged to Resolved. Photos of corrected work attached. Know exactly where your issue stands.

## Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy

User access controls aren't standalone. They're the foundation every other module builds on. When you grant someone permission, the entire system respects that decision.

### Integration Cards

**Employee Management**
Permission controls determine who can create employees, assign roles, and modify profiles. Only owners add team members. No unauthorized hiring.

**Payroll & Time Tracking**
Financial permissions filter what appears in payroll dashboards. Supervisors see hours worked. Technicians see their own time. Owners see full cost visibility.

**Project Management**
Project permissions control who creates, edits, assigns, and views projects. Owners create and assign. Supervisors manage their projects. Technicians see their work.

**Safety & Compliance**
Safety permissions determine who submits, reviews, and approves documentation. Clear responsibility chain from technician to safety officer to owner.

**Feedback Management**
Access controls route feedback appropriately. Residents submit. Building managers track. Your team resolves. Everyone stays in their lane.

**Analytics & Reporting**
Every report filters to the user's permission level. Dashboards show only authorized data. No accidental exposure.

## How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header

Stop Managing Access. Start Managing Growth.

### Body Copy

Every hour you spend gatekeeping information is an hour you're not spending on growth.

Your supervisor calls because he can't create a project. You stop what you're doing to log in for him. Your building manager forwards another resident email. You relay the response. Your technician texts a complaint from the field. You copy it into a spreadsheet.

None of this is your job. All of it consumes your day.

OnRopePro eliminates the gatekeeping. Your supervisor creates projects without seeing payroll. Your building manager tracks feedback without being the middleman. Your technician logs issues without remembering to tell you later.

You get visibility without bottlenecks. Control without micromanagement. Protection without paranoia.

The information you need to see finds you. The information others need stays with them. And the time you used to spend managing access? That's yours again.

## FAQs

**Can I change someone's permissions after I've set them up?**
Yes. Permissions can be modified anytime from the employee management dashboard. Changes take effect immediately on their next login.

**What happens when a building manager leaves?**
Buildings have accounts, not building managers. The new manager changes the building password. Access transfers instantly. The former manager is locked out. No vendor coordination required.

**Can technicians see each other's pay rates?**
Only if you grant financial permissions, which you control individually per employee. By default, technicians see only their own work records and assigned projects.

**How do residents get access to the portal?**
Building codes. The code appears on elevator notices, gets shared by technicians on-site, or sent by property managers. Resident enters the code, creates an account, instant access to their building's portal.

**What if a resident accidentally registers for the wrong unit?**
The system prompts: "There's already an account for this unit. Are you a new resident?" If they confirm, access transfers. If they realize the mistake, they go back and enter the correct unit.

**Can building managers see financial information?**
No. Building manager accounts have read-only access to project progress, feedback status, and work history. They cannot see rates, costs, or internal financial data.

**How does feedback tracking work?**
Every submission timestamps automatically: when it was opened, when it was acknowledged, when it was resolved. The system calculates average response time and generates exportable reports for strata councils or property managers.

**Is my company's data separated from other OnRopePro customers?**
Completely. Multi-tenant architecture means your data exists in a separate partition. Every query, every API call filters to your company only. A security issue with another account cannot expose your information.

**What permissions are available?**
44+ individual permissions across categories: financial (rates, costs, margins), operational (projects, scheduling), safety (inspections, documentation), inventory (equipment, consumables), and employee management (hiring, roles).

**Can I create custom roles?**
Yes. While the system includes standard roles (Operations Manager, Supervisor, Technician, etc.), you can create custom positions for unique needs like Inventory Manager or Safety Officer, then assign whatever permissions that role requires.
