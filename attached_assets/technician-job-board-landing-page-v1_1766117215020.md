# Technician Job Board Landing Page

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025  
**Target Audience:** Urban Rope Technicians (Career Climbers, Multi-Employer Hustlers, Freedom Seekers)  
**Strategic Goal:** Tech acquisition → FREE signup → PLUS upgrade (free during launch)  
**Core Principle:** Clarity = Conversion

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware to solution-aware (they know Indeed sucks, may not know a rope-specific alternative exists)

**Core Insight:** Rope access techs waste hours scrolling through irrelevant pipe fitter and welder jobs. They want a place where every job is relevant and every employer is legit.

**Psychological Frameworks:**
1. **Identity-Based** - "You're a rope access professional, not a construction generalist"
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - One platform, 100% relevant jobs
3. **Autonomy** - Full control over visibility and career decisions
4. **Loss Aversion** - Missing opportunities buried in generic job boards
5. **Community Belonging** - Closed ecosystem built for rope techs by rope techs

**Emotional Territory:** Control + Recognition + Professional Pride

Every rope access technician deserves access to real opportunities. Here's exactly what you get.

---

## Section 3: Problems Solved

### Section Header
**Sound Familiar?**

---

**"I search 'rope access' on Indeed and get 50 results. 48 of them are pipe fitters, welders, or offshore oil rigs."**

You spend 30 minutes scrolling through irrelevant listings to find 2-3 that might be building maintenance. Half of those turn out to be posted by staffing agencies that don't understand the industry.

OnRopePro's Job Board is a closed ecosystem. Every job is rope access building maintenance. Filter by city, job type, and certification level. Every listing is verified. Every employer is real.

---

**"I don't want my current boss to know I'm looking."**

You're employed but casually browsing. Maybe testing the market. You don't want to flip your LinkedIn to "Open to Work" and have it get back to your crew lead.

Profile visibility is a toggle. Turn it on when actively looking. Turn it off when you're not. Browse and apply to jobs with your profile hidden. Only reveal yourself when you're ready.

---

**"I applied to a job and never heard anything. Then saw it reposted two weeks later."**

Black hole applications. No acknowledgment. No timeline. Just silence.

OnRopePro shows application status in real time. Submitted. Viewed. Under consideration. Offer sent. You always know where you stand.

---

**"Every time I switch jobs, I have to re-enter all my certifications, emergency contacts, and upload the same documents again."**

Three hours of paperwork just to start working. New void cheque. New tax forms. New copies of your certifications.

Your OnRopePro profile is portable. When an employer already on the platform hires you, onboarding takes 10 seconds. They enter your rate and permissions. Everything else is already there.

---

**"I want to know if a company is legit before I apply."**

Is this a real operation? Do they pay on time? Are their guys happy?

Every employer on OnRopePro is verified as a rope access building maintenance company. You can see company information before you apply. No mystery postings. No bait-and-switch.

---

## Section 4: How It Works

### Section Header
**Three Steps. Under Two Minutes.**

---

**Step 1: Create Your Account**
Enter your name, email, and IRATA or SPRAT certification number. Your cert number becomes your permanent identifier. 60 seconds.

**Step 2: Complete Your Profile**
Add your certifications, experience, expected pay rate, and upload your resume. This information auto-attaches to every application. Do it once.

**Step 3: Browse and Apply (or Get Found)**
Search jobs filtered by your city and certification level. Apply with one tap. Or toggle your profile visible and let employers come to you.

### CTA
**Create Your Free Account Now**

## Section 5: Why It's Different

### Section Header
**Not Indeed. Not Craigslist. Not a Facebook Group.**

---

| OnRopePro | Indeed/LinkedIn/Craigslist |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Closed ecosystem: Only rope access building maintenance | Open to everyone: pipe fitters, welders, random construction |
| 100% of jobs are relevant | 2-5% of jobs are relevant |
| Verified employers | Anyone can post |
| Apply in 30 seconds | 15-20 minutes per application |
| Your profile follows you | Start over with every job |
| See application status | Black hole submissions |
| Expected pay rate visible | Surprise salary conversations |
| No per-application fees for employers | Indeed charges $22+ per application |

---

### The Network Effect

More techs on the platform = more employers posting jobs = more opportunities for you.

You're not just signing up. You're building the only job board that actually understands rope access.

---

## Section 6: For Every Type of Tech

### Section Header
**Whether You're Climbing the Ladder or Chasing Freedom**

---

**Career Climbers (L1/L2 Working Toward L3)**
Your hours are tracked. Your certifications are visible. When you hit 1,000 hours and apply for that L2, your documentation is organized and exportable. No scrambling.

**Multi-Employer Hustlers (Managing 2-4 Companies)**
One dashboard for all your employers. See your total hours across all jobs. Never double-book. Never lose track of which company owes you what.

**Freedom Seekers (Moving City to City)**
Your profile is portable. Work in Vancouver this spring, Toronto this summer, Seattle in the fall. Your professional identity travels with you. 10-second onboarding at every new employer who uses OnRopePro.

---

## Section 7: FAQ

**"Is there a cost to sign up?"**
No. FREE tier is free forever. PLUS tier is free during our technician launch.

**"What's the catch with PLUS being free?"**
No catch. We're launching to technicians first. We want 500+ rope access professionals on the platform before we start charging employers. Early adopters get PLUS free.

**"Will you spam me?"**
No. You'll get job offer notifications (if you enable visibility) and application status updates. No marketing emails unless you opt in.

**"Can my current employer see that I'm on here?"**
Not unless you toggle your profile visible. You can browse and apply to jobs completely privately.

**"What if the employer I apply to isn't on OnRopePro?"**
Then they don't have access to this talent pool. All employers on the platform are verified rope access building maintenance companies.

**"How is this different from Facebook groups or word of mouth?"**
Facebook posts disappear. Word of mouth is unreliable. OnRopePro is permanent, searchable, and organized. Your profile stays updated. Your applications are tracked. Your career history is documented.

**"Can I use this if I'm not IRATA or SPRAT certified?"**
Yes. We support both IRATA and SPRAT certifications, plus non-certified building maintenance workers. Your certification level (or lack of it) is visible to employers, so they know what they're getting.

**"What happens to my data if I delete my account?"**
You own your data. Delete your account anytime and your profile is removed from employer searches. Any employer connections are severed.

**"How do I upgrade to PLUS?"**
Toggle it in your settings. During the technician launch, the upgrade is immediate and free. No credit card required.

---

## Section 8: Final CTA

### Section Header

You just need to show up.

## Implementation Notes

### TSX/Design Considerations
- Mobile-first layout (techs browse on phones between drops)
- Tier comparison should be side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Toggle demonstration GIF showing visibility on/off
- Real screenshots of job listings interface
- No walls of text (scanners, not readers)

### A/B Test Recommendations
- **Test 1:** Headline - "Zero Pipe Fitter Listings" vs "Only Rope Access Jobs"
- **Test 2:** CTA - "Create Your Free Account" vs "Get Started Free"
- **Test 3:** PLUS framing - "Free During Launch" vs "First 500 Technicians"

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Hero headline + CTA (above fold)
2. Tier breakdown (most important section)
3. Problems solved (validation)
4. How it works (reduce friction)
5. Comparison table (differentiation)
6. FAQ (objection handling)
7. Final CTA (conversion)

### Key Phrases for Repeat Use
- "Closed ecosystem" (industry specificity)
- "Every employer is verified" (trust)
- "100% relevant" (cognitive load reduction)
- "Toggle your visibility" (control/autonomy)
- "Portable profile" (freedom seekers)
- "10-second onboarding" (friction reduction)
