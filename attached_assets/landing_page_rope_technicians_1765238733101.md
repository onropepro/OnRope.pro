# OnRopePro: Rope Technician Landing Page

**Document Type:** Landing Page Copy  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Layout:** 70% left column (marketing) / 30% right column (scrolling problems)  
**Primary Goal:** Free account signup → referral to Plus upgrade

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** Rope access technicians (IRATA/SPRAT certified)  
**Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware (know current systems suck, unaware solution exists)  
**Core Insight:** You fill out the same forms at every job, text timesheets that get logged wrong, and fill out your logbook two weeks late making stuff up because you can't remember what you worked on  
**Psychological Frameworks:** Relief-based triggers, Effort Justification, Reciprocal Altruism, Identity (professional pride)  
**Emotional Territory:** Frustration → Relief → "Finally, someone built this"

---

## LEFT COLUMN (70%) — Marketing Copy

### Hero Section

**Primary Headline:**
# You Work. Everything Else Is Automatic.

**Subhead:**
One profile. Any employer. Hours submit themselves. Certs already verified. Logbook entries you didn't have to make up. Onboarding done before you arrive.

**Hero CTA Button:**
`Create Your Free Profile →`

**Trust Signal (below button):**
*Free forever. No credit card. Takes 2 minutes.*

---

### Section 1: The Problem (Agitate)

**Section Header:**
## Same forms. Same timesheets. Same logbook you're making up.

**Body Copy:**

New employer. New banking forms. New emergency contact sheet. New void cheque request. Again.

Every Friday: text your hours to the office. Hope they log them right. Dispute the paycheck when they don't.

And your logbook? You're filling it out two weeks late, staring at your phone trying to remember what building you were at, what tasks you did, making stuff up because who actually remembers.

Eight years on rope. Level 3 IRATA. Hundreds of buildings.

And you're still filling out the same forms, still texting timesheets, still guessing at logbook entries like it's your first month.

**There's a better way.**

---

### Section 2: The Solution (Introduce)

**Section Header:**
## Set up once. Plug into any employer. Done.

**Body Copy:**

OnRopePro gives you a portable professional identity that **connects** to any company using the platform.

**Here's what that means:**

**Day 1 at a new job?**
You plug in. They instantly have your IRATA/SPRAT certs, first aid, driver's abstract, banking info, emergency contact—verified and ready. The only thing your employer has to do is enter your salary and permissions. That's it. No forms. No "bring a void cheque." No half-day orientation.

**Every day after that?**
Your work hours, buildings, tasks—logged automatically. Clock in, do your work, clock out. Hours submitted. No timesheets. No texts to the office. No "I swear I worked 9 hours" disputes.

**When you fill out your logbook?**
Every session is recorded. Building address, tasks, height, hours. Fill out your IRATA logbook from actual records—not fuzzy memory two weeks later.

**Change employers?**
Unplug from Company A. Plug into Company B. Same instant onboarding. Same automatic logging. Your profile stays yours.

**Work multiple companies?**
With Plus, connect to unlimited employers simultaneously. Four days at Company A, weekends at Company B, your own clients on the side. One profile handles it all.

### Section 5: How It Works

**Section Header:**
## 2 minutes to set up. Automatic from there.

**Steps:**

**1. Create your free profile**
Name, email, IRATA/SPRAT ID. Done in 2 minutes.

**2. Add your credentials once**
Upload certs, first aid, banking info. You'll never enter this again.

**3. Plug into your employer**
If they use OnRopePro, connect your account. They instantly see your verified credentials—zero paperwork on their end, zero on yours.

**4. Work. Everything logs automatically.**
Clock in through the app. Your hours, buildings, and tasks submit to your employer automatically. No timesheets. No texts. No disputes. And when you fill out your IRATA logbook later? You have actual records to reference.

**5. Share your code, unlock Plus**
One tech signs up with your referral → you both get Plus. Unlimited employer connections, exportable history, expiry alerts, job board access.

**CTA:**
`Create Your Free Profile →`

### Section 6: For the Skeptics

**Section Header:**
## "What's the catch?"

**FAQ Format:**

**Why is this free?**
Employers pay. You don't. When you plug your verified profile into a new company, they skip hours of onboarding paperwork and get automatic hour tracking. That's worth paying for. Your profile stays yours forever—we just make it portable.

**What does "plug in" actually mean?**
If your employer uses OnRopePro, you connect your account to theirs with one tap. Instantly, they see your verified certs, banking info, and emergency contact—no forms to fill. From then on, your work hours submit automatically when you clock in/out. No timesheets. No texts. No "did you log yesterday?"

**What if my employer doesn't use OnRopePro?**
You still get all the personal benefits—document storage, logbook digitization, certification tracking, exportable work history. And when you eventually work for a company that does use it (or convince your current one), you're already set up for instant onboarding.

**Who owns my data?**
You do. Export it anytime. Delete it anytime. Unplug from any employer anytime. Your profile, your rules.

**Is my SIN/banking info safe?**
Bank-level encryption. Shared only when YOU connect to an employer. Never sold. Never shared otherwise. You control access.

**What's the referral thing about?**
Share your unique code. When one tech signs up using it, you both get Plus—unlimited employer connections, exportable history, expiry alerts. Not MLM. Not commission. Just mutual benefit.

### Section 7: Final CTA

## RIGHT COLUMN (30%) — Scrolling Problems

**Design Notes:**
- Multiple rows of horizontally auto-scrolling text
- Alternating scroll directions (row 1 left, row 2 right, row 3 left, etc.)
- Muted/gray text color, smaller font than main copy
- Each problem is a short, punchy phrase
- Problems scroll continuously, creating ambient awareness of pain points
- On hover: scroll pauses (optional)

### Row 1 (scroll left)
```
New job, same paperwork again • Filling out banking forms for the 4th time • "Bring a void cheque" • Emergency contact form again • Half-day orientation • Why doesn't this follow me? •
```

### Row 2 (scroll right)
```
Texting hours to the office • Timesheet every Friday • "Did you log yesterday?" • Forgot to submit my time • Hope they entered it right • My word against their spreadsheet •
```

### Row 3 (scroll left)
```
Filling out my logbook two weeks late • What building was I at? • Making stuff up because I can't remember • Staring at my phone trying to recall • 10 pages of guesswork • This can't be right •
```

### Row 4 (scroll right)
```
$63 missing from my check • Supervisor logged wrong hours • Payroll disputes every month • "I swear I worked 9 hours" • Can't prove anything • Who's actually tracking this? •
```

### Row 5 (scroll left)
```
8 years experience, zero proof • "I've done hundreds of rope transfers" • No data for raise negotiations • Gut feel isn't leverage • How do I prove what I've done? •
```

### Row 6 (scroll right)
```
Indeed is useless for rope access • Endless search, zero results • Where are the real postings? • Nobody hiring on job boards • Industry jobs are invisible •
```

### Row 7 (scroll left)
```
IRATA expiring next week • Nobody told me • Scrambling for recert • Almost got caught on site • Why isn't there an alert? • This could have been prevented •
```

### Row 8 (scroll right)
```
Moonlighting is a nightmare • Can't work two companies easily • Weekend jobs with no system • Building my own clients with paper • One profile should handle this •
```

## Alternate Headlines (A/B Testing)

1. **You Work. Everything Else Is Automatic.** (primary - relief/automation)
2. **Stop Making Up Your Logbook Entries.** (specific pain - memory problem)

4. **Set Up Once. Never Fill Out Onboarding Forms Again.** (specific relief)
5. **178 Rope Transfers. 3,500 Deviations. Actual Proof.** (quantified experience)

## A/B Test Recommendations

**Test 1: Headline Framing**
- A: "You Work. Everything Else Is Automatic." (relief/automation)
- B: "Stop Making Up Your Logbook Entries." (specific pain)
- Why: Test broad automation promise vs. specific relatable pain

**Test 2: CTA Copy**
- A: "Create Your Free Profile"
- B: "Get Started Free"
- C: "Set Up Once →"
- Why: "Set Up Once" reinforces the core promise in the CTA itself

**Test 3: Subhead Length**
- A: Full subhead (6 benefits)
- B: Short subhead: "One profile. Any employer. Hours, certs, logs—automatic."
- Why: Test information density vs. punchy simplicity

**Test 4: Referral Framing**
- A: "Share with one tech → you both get Plus"
- B: "Unlock Plus together—just one referral"
- Why: Testing reciprocal framing vs. achievement framing

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Scrolling Problems Column

```css
/* Example CSS for scrolling rows */
.problem-row {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  animation: scroll-left 30s linear infinite;
}

.problem-row.reverse {
  animation: scroll-right 30s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes scroll-left {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

@keyframes scroll-right {
  0% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

/* Styling */
.problem-row {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #6b7280; /* gray-500 */
  padding: 12px 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
}
```

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop:** 70/30 split side by side
- **Tablet:** 60/40 split, smaller font
- **Mobile:** Stack vertically—marketing copy first, then 3-4 problem rows as ambient footer

### Color Palette Suggestion

- **Primary CTA:** Orange (#f97316) or Green (#22c55e) — stands out, action-oriented
- **Text:** Dark gray (#1f2937) for readability
- **Problem column:** Light gray (#6b7280) — ambient, not distracting
- **Background:** White main column, light gray (#f9fafb) problem column
