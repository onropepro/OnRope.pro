## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware to Solution-aware
Rope access company owners know their client/building data is scattered. They may not realize a purpose-built CRM exists for their industry.

**Core Insight:** Generic CRMs treat buildings as addresses. In rope access, buildings ARE the business. Floor counts determine rope lengths. Drop targets drive scheduling. Parking stalls affect logistics. The CRM needs to understand building operations, not just contact management.

**Psychological Frameworks Applied:**
1. **Cognitive Load Reduction** - One centralized system vs. 5 scattered tools
2. **Loss Aversion** - Protect against data entry errors that cost jobs
3. **Efficiency/ROI** - $34 cost = 20+ hours saved (concrete math)
4. **Future Pacing** - Enter data once, use forever

**Emotional Territory:** Relief. Control. Professional confidence.

**Formula:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) for primary sections

## 1. Hero Section

### Primary Headline

**"Your client info lives in 5 places. Your building specs in 3. And your crew just showed up with short ropes."**

### Alternative Headlines

1. "Stop typing the same floor counts into the same spreadsheet for the same building every single year."

2. "One client. Three buildings. 36 data entries per year. Or one."

3. "The building is 25 floors. You typed 15. Half a day gone."

### Subheadline

Every client. Every building. Every spec. One system, one entry, forever. Select a client, and the floors, drops, parking, and address auto-populate into your next project in seconds.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header

**The Spreadsheet Shuffle That Never Ends**

### Body Copy

Building LMS-1234 needs window cleaning next month. Where's the floor count? The Excel file. Where's the property manager's number? That text thread. Where's last year's drop schedule? A photo of your handwritten notes. Where's the billing address? An email from 2023.

Every project starts this way. Digging through old files, scrolling through conversations, hoping the numbers are still accurate. And when you finally piece it together, you type it all in again. The same building. The same specs. The same 15 minutes of your life.

OnRopePro ends the shuffle. Enter a client once. Attach their buildings with full specs (floors, drops, parking, units). When you create next year's project, select the client from a dropdown. Every field populates automatically. The data you entered in 2025 autofills in 2026 and beyond.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header

**What This Module Does**

### Subheadline

The central hub connecting clients, buildings, projects, and billing in one system.

### Intro Copy

The CRM module stores your clients and their building portfolios with full operational specifications, then auto-populates that data whenever you create new projects.

---

### Card 1: Client Portfolio Management

Every client record holds multiple buildings. One property management company managing 12 towers? One client record, 12 LMS entries, each with individual specs.

**What gets stored:**
- Primary contact: name, phone, email, company, address
- Billing address (when different from service address)
- Unlimited building portfolio (LMS/VIS/EMS numbers)
- Relationship history across all projects

---

### Card 2: Building Specification Database

Each building stores the operational data rope access crews need. Floor counts determine rope lengths. Drop targets drive scheduling. Parking stall counts affect crew logistics.

**What gets tracked per building:**
- Strata plan number and display name
- Full street address
- Total floors (stories)
- Unit and parking stall counts
- Daily drop target
- 4-elevation drop counts (North/East/South/West)

---

### Card 3: Autofill Intelligence

When creating a new project, select a client. If that client has multiple buildings, select the building. The system auto-populates every field from your stored specs.

**What auto-populates:**
- Strata plan number and building name
- Building address and floor count
- Daily drop target and 4-elevation drops
- Unit count and parking stalls

---

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**Your building data becomes an asset, not a scavenger hunt.** Every client. Every building. Every specification. Stored once, searchable instantly, auto-filled into every future project. No more digging through old files.

**Project setup drops from 15 minutes to 2.** Select client, select building, done. Floor counts, drop targets, addresses, contacts, all populate automatically. Three new contracts in one day? 6 minutes of setup instead of 45.

**Data entry errors stop costing you jobs.** You typed 15 floors instead of 25. Crew shows up with short ropes. Half-day wasted. Client questioning your professionalism. Autofill intelligence eliminates manual entry entirely. Same verified data, every project.

---

### For Operations Managers & Supervisors

**Equipment planning gets specific.** Before dispatching crews, you know exact floor counts (which determines rope lengths), parking availability, and access points. No more calling the owner mid-meeting.

**Duration estimates become accurate.** Building specs feed directly into scheduling. A 10-floor drop takes different time than a 50-floor drop. The data is already there.

---

### For Technicians

**Your job info is complete before you arrive.** Building address, floor count, daily drop target, and 4-elevation breakdown, already in the project. No surprises on site.

---

### For Property Managers

**Your building specs are on file permanently.** When you request service next year, no one needs to ask "how many floors again?" Your data stays accurate across every project.

---

### For Building Managers

**Consistent service from day one.** Companies using OnRopePro already know your building's specs. Less back-and-forth. Faster project starts.

---

## 5. Key Features

### Intro Copy

Six capabilities that transform scattered data into operational intelligence.

---

### Feature 1: One Client, Unlimited Buildings

Most property management companies oversee multiple towers. Strata Corp Ltd manages 3 buildings? One client record stores all three, each with individual specifications. No duplicate contacts. No fragmented data.

---

### Feature 2: Regional ID Flexibility

Vancouver uses LMS and EMS. Vancouver Island uses VIS. OnRopePro accepts any format. Your strata numbers work however your region names them.

---

### Feature 3: Reverse Client Creation

Starting a project for a brand new client? Enter the details directly in the project form. After saving, the system prompts: "Save as new client?" One click creates both the project AND the permanent client record.

---

### Feature 4: 4-Elevation Drop Tracking

North, East, South, West drop counts stored per building. When crews arrive, the elevation breakdown is already in the project. No site surveys required.

---

### Feature 5: Separate Billing Addresses

Service address and billing address often differ. Store both. Invoices route correctly automatically.

---

### Feature 6: Permission-Controlled Access

Not everyone should see or edit client records. View-only access for those who need to reference. Full manage access for those who maintain the database.

---

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Employers (Company Owners)

**"I'm entering the same building information over and over again."**

Strata Corp Ltd manages 3 buildings. Every year, window cleaning at all three. Without centralized records, you re-enter 25 floors, 4-elevation drop counts, parking stall info, and contact details for each building, for each project. That's 36+ manual data entries per year for one client.

Enter client and building information once. Select them from a dropdown for every future project. Building specs entered in 2025 auto-populate in 2026 and beyond.

---

**"Our client information is scattered across Excel, texts, and paper."**

Property manager Jane Doe calls about building LMS-1234. You need her phone number, the building address, floor count, and last year's drop targets. That information exists in 4 different places, and you're not sure which version is current.

All contact details, building specs, and project history organized in one searchable system. Find everything by client name, building address, or LMS number.

---

**"Manual data entry errors are costing us money and credibility."**

You type "15 floors" instead of "25 floors" for a new project. Crew shows up with short ropes. Half-day wasted, emergency equipment run, client questioning your professionalism.

Autofill intelligence eliminates manual entry. Building specs flow automatically from stored records. The same verified data used for every project.

---

### For Operations Managers & Supervisors

**"I need building specs for equipment planning but can't find them."**

Building LMS-4567 is scheduled for Wednesday. The new technician asks what rope length to bring. You don't have that building's specs handy. You call the owner. They're in a meeting. The technician brings wrong equipment.

Every building's floor count, drop targets, and specs are searchable instantly. Equipment planning happens with complete information.

---

**"I'm duplicating setup work for repeat buildings."**

Same building, same client, same specs as last year. But you're entering everything from scratch because there's no permanent record.

Building specs persist across years. Last year's 25-floor building with 4 north drops and 6 south drops? Still 25 floors with 4 north and 6 south.

---

### For Technicians

**"I arrive at jobs without knowing the building layout."**

How many floors? What's the daily drop target? Which elevations have the most work? You find out when you get there.

Project details include full building specs before you leave. Floor count, drop targets, and 4-elevation breakdown, all visible.

---

### For Property Managers

**"I have to re-explain my building every time I call for service."**

Different rep each time. Same questions about floors, parking, access. Feels like they've never worked on your building before.

Your building specs are on file permanently. Request service and your details auto-populate. No re-explanation needed.

---

### For Building Managers

**"Vendor coordination takes too long because basic info is always missing."**

Every new vendor needs building orientation. Floors, access points, parking limitations. The same briefing, different company, every time.

Companies using OnRopePro already have your building's specs. Less coordination. Faster project starts.

---

## 7. Measurable Results

### Time Savings

Project setup drops from 10-15 minutes to under 2 minutes. For companies creating 10+ projects monthly, that's 2+ hours reclaimed for actual operations.

---

### Error Reduction

Autofill intelligence eliminates transposed numbers, wrong floor counts, and outdated contact info. The same verified data populates every project.

---

### Cost Efficiency

The subscription cost equals approximately one hour of Level 2 technician pay per seat ($34). The system saves 20+ hours per employee per month in administrative work.

*Validated quote: "The $99 a month... it's like hiring three people for one hour a month... And you need to do all this... Impossible."*

---

### Data Centralization

Client records that previously lived across 4-5 systems (Excel, texts, emails, paper notes) now exist in one searchable database.

---

## 8. Other Modules This Module Communicates With

### Intro Copy

The CRM is the foundation. Building and client data flows into every other module.

---

### Project Management

Client selection auto-populates building specs into new projects. Floor counts, drop targets, and addresses transfer automatically.

---

### Payroll & Financial

Client billing addresses flow into invoice generation. No manual address entry for each payment cycle.

---

### Quoting & Sales Pipeline

Historical building data enables accurate quote generation. Past project specs inform future pricing.

---

### Work Sessions & Time Tracking

Building-specific daily drop targets set baseline expectations for session productivity.

---

### Safety & Compliance

Building specs (floor counts, elevation data) inform equipment requirements and safety planning.

---

## 9. How Will This Module Improve Your Business?

### Section Header

**Stop Managing Data. Start Managing Growth.**

### Body Copy

Right now, every new project means hunting. Client contact in one spreadsheet. Building address in another. Floor counts in a text message you sent yourself 8 months ago. Last year's drop schedule in a photo of your handwritten notes.

You spend 15 minutes piecing together information that should take 15 seconds. And then you type it all in. Again. For a building you've worked on three times already.

With the CRM module, that building data exists permanently. One entry. One source. Every future project pulls from the same verified specs. Select client, select building, start scheduling.

The 45 minutes you spent setting up 3 new contracts? Now 6 minutes. The floor count error that sent crews with wrong equipment? Eliminated. The scattered information that made you look disorganized to clients? Centralized and professional.

You didn't start a rope access company to manage spreadsheets. The CRM gives you back the time to run an actual business.

---

## 10. FAQs

**"Can one client have multiple buildings?"**

Yes. This is the core design. One client (property management company or strata) can have unlimited buildings, each with their own LMS number and specifications. Strata Corp Ltd manages 3 buildings: LMS-1234, LMS-5678, and LMS-9012. All three are stored under the single Strata Corp Ltd client record.

---

**"What happens if I create a project without selecting an existing client?"**

The system prompts you to save the entered details as a new client after project creation. You don't need to create the client first.

---

**"Is my building data shared with other companies?"**

No. Currently, building data is private to your company. Each company maintains its own client/building database.

---

**"What's the difference between LMS, EMS, and VIS?"**

Regional naming conventions for building identifiers. LMS and EMS are used in Vancouver. VIS is used on Vancouver Island. OnRopePro accepts any format.

---

**"Why store parking stall counts?"**

Parking directly impacts operations. Crews need to know: Is there loading zone access? How many vehicles can park? This affects equipment delivery and crew logistics.

---

**"What does the 'stories' field actually do?"**

Stories (floor count) determines two critical things: how long a drop will take (different on a 10-floor vs. 50-floor building) and what equipment you need (rope length requirements). It's operational data, not just address info.

---

**"How does autofill intelligence work?"**

When creating a new project, select a client from the dropdown. If that client has multiple buildings configured, select the specific building. The system automatically populates: strata plan number, building name, address, floor count, daily drop target, 4-elevation drops, unit count, and parking stalls.

---

**"Who can access client records?"**

Permission-controlled. "View Client" permission allows read-only access. "Manage Client" permission allows creating, editing, and deleting records.

---

**"Does my building data carry over to next year?"**

Yes. Permanently. Building specs entered in 2025 auto-populate when you create 2026 projects for the same client. One entry, use forever.

---

**"What if we already have client data in spreadsheets?"**

You'll need to enter clients once into OnRopePro to start. After that, no more spreadsheet updates. The system becomes your single source of truth.
