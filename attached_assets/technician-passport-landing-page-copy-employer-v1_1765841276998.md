# Technician Passport Landing Page Copy (Employer-Focused)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Module:** Technician Account (Technician Passport)  
**Purpose:** Landing page targeting rope access company owners showing value of pre-existing technician network  
**Primary Audience:** Employers (Company Owners)

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Audience:** Rope access company owners (5-50 technicians, $1-2M revenue)  
**Awareness Stage:** Problem-aware (hiring is painful) to Solution-aware (know software exists, don't know about OnRopePro's network)  
**Core Insight:** You're still onboarding techs with paper forms while hundreds of qualified professionals already have verified digital profiles waiting to connect. Every hour spent on paperwork is an hour not spent on billable work.

**Psychological Frameworks:**
- Loss Aversion (time and money lost to manual processes)
- Social Proof (other techs already using the platform)
- Cognitive Load Reduction (one system replaces many)
- Risk Reduction (verify before you hire)
- Efficiency/ROI (B2B demands metrics)

**Emotional Territory:** Relief, control, competitive advantage

## 2. Problem Statement Section

### Section Header
**Hiring Shouldn't Take Longer Than the First Day of Work**

### Body Copy
You find a qualified tech. Level 2, First Aid, available immediately. Perfect.

Then the paperwork starts.

Email the onboarding forms. Wait for them to fill out banking details. Chase the certification copies. Verify with IRATA (eventually). Send safety documentation. Wait for signatures. File everything (somewhere). Hope nothing gets lost before the next audit.

By the time they're officially "onboarded," you've burned 60+ minutes of admin time. Multiply that by every hire, every season.

Meanwhile, that tech filled out the exact same forms for their last three employers. The same banking details. The same emergency contacts. The same certification copies.

OnRopePro eliminates the redundancy. Technicians create one profile that travels with them. When they connect to your company, their verified credentials, work history, and personal details transfer in 10 seconds.

Your job is running projects. Not chasing paperwork.

## 3. What This Module Does

### Section Header
**What You Get When a Tech Connects**

### Intro Copy
Every technician with an OnRopePro Passport carries their complete professional identity. When they accept your invitation, you receive:

### Card 1: Verified Credentials
Know exactly who you're hiring. Before they start.

Search any IRATA or SPRAT license number and instantly see: name, certification level, First Aid status, and location. The tech approves the connection before you access their full profile. No more blurry photos of certifications. No more hiring based on unverified claims.

**What you verify:**
- IRATA/SPRAT level and license number
- Certification expiry dates
- First Aid and supplementary qualifications
- Work history across previous employers
- Personal safety rating

### Card 2: Complete Onboarding Data
Everything you need for payroll and compliance. Already filled out.

When a tech connects, you receive their banking details, SIN (if provided), emergency contacts, and address. No forms to email. No data to re-enter. No waiting for responses that never come.

**What transfers automatically:**
- Banking details for direct deposit
- Address and contact information
- Emergency contact details
- Resume and certifications
- Tax information (optional)

### Card 3: Automatic Safety Compliance
100% acknowledgment rate. Zero chasing.

When techs accept your invitation, they must read and sign all your safety procedures before accessing the Work Dashboard. New safety document added mid-season? Existing techs can't continue until they acknowledge it. Complete audit trail with timestamps.

**What gets enforced:**
- Safety procedure acknowledgment before work begins
- Mandatory document signing for all new policies
- Harness inspection completion tracking
- Audit-ready compliance records
- Zero "I didn't know" excuses

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits

### For Company Owners

**Onboard in 10 seconds, not 60 minutes.** A tech with an OnRopePro Passport connects to your company with one click. You receive their complete profile instantly. Banking details, certifications, emergency contacts, work history. No forms. No verification calls. No data entry.

**Verify qualifications before you hire.** Search any IRATA license number and see their level, First Aid status, expiry date, and location. The tech must approve the connection before you receive full access. Never hire based on unverified claims again.

**Guarantee safety compliance.** Techs cannot access your Work Dashboard until they've read and signed every safety procedure. When you add a new policy, existing techs must acknowledge it before continuing. 100% compliance rate. Instant audit response.

**Eliminate payroll disputes.** When techs log hours through OnRopePro, every session records automatically: building address, heights, tasks performed, duration. Complete, timestamped records replace paper timesheets and "he said, she said" disputes.

### For Supervisors and Ops Managers

**See who's actually qualified.** View certification levels, expiry dates, and safety ratings for every tech on your roster. Assign the right people to the right projects. Know when someone's cert is about to expire before it causes problems on site.

**Track work in real-time.** See which techs are assigned to which projects. View logged hours by building, by elevation, by task. No more piecing together paper timesheets at the end of the week.

### For Technicians

**One profile, every employer.** Techs create their Passport once and carry it across their entire career. When they join your company, everything transfers automatically. When they leave, their work history goes with them. They're not starting over every time.

**Automatic hour tracking.** Every work session logs to their Passport with building address, heights, tasks, and duration. They never have to reconstruct months of work from memory for their IRATA logbook again.

### For Building Managers

**Verify your contractor's techs instantly.** Through the Building Manager Portal, property managers can view certification levels, expiry dates, and safety ratings for techs working on their buildings. Protect their liability. Protect yours.

## 6. Problems Solved

### For Company Owners

**"Onboarding paperwork gets lost in email chaos."**

New hire accepts job. You email safety documentation. They read it (maybe). They sign it (eventually). They email it back (sometimes to the wrong person). You file it (somewhere). Six months later, an insurance auditor asks for proof. Three are missing. Two have unsigned pages. You spend two hours searching inboxes.

When a tech accepts your OnRopePro invitation, they must read and sign all safety documentation before accessing the Work Dashboard. Documents stored permanently with audit timestamps. No dashboard access until compliance is complete.

**"I can't verify a tech's qualifications quickly."**

Applicant claims Level 2 with First Aid. You ask for copies. They send blurry phone photos. You email IRATA for verification. Days pass. You need bodies on site tomorrow.

Search their license number in OnRopePro. Name, level, First Aid status, location appear instantly. The tech approves the connection before you access their full profile. Verified in seconds, not days.

**"A tech claimed hours that didn't match the project."**

Paper timesheets show 8 hours. No detail on which building, which elevation, what tasks. The client disputes the invoice. You can't prove the work happened as billed.

When techs connect to your company, every work session logs automatically: building address, heights, specific tasks (descend, ascend, rigging, rope transfer, re-anchor), and duration. Complete, timestamped, undisputable.

**"My supervisor discovered an expired certification on site."**

A tech's IRATA lapsed two weeks ago. Nobody noticed. The building manager asks for documentation. You scramble. The client threatens contract penalties.

OnRopePro shows certification expiry dates for every connected tech. Yellow badge at 60 days. Red badge at 30 days. You see problems before they become emergencies.

**"Every new hire means 60+ minutes of paperwork."**

Banking details. Emergency contacts. Certification copies. Tax forms. Safety acknowledgments. The same information you collected from their last employer. The same information you'll collect again when the next tech joins.

Techs with OnRopePro Passports carry everything with them. One click to connect. Complete profile transfers in 10 seconds. Your admin time drops to nearly zero.

### For Building Managers

**"I can't verify contractor technician qualifications."**

You hire a rope access company, but how do you know their technicians are certified? You request documentation. It takes days. Certifications might be expired. A resident complains about workers outside their window. The strata council demands proof.

Through the Building Manager Portal, property managers view technician profiles for contractors working on their buildings: certification levels, expiry dates, safety ratings. Real-time verification without phone calls.

## 8. The Network Effect

### Section Header
**Hundreds of Techs Already Have Passports. Your Next Hire Might Be One of Them.**

### Body Copy
OnRopePro isn't starting from zero.

Technicians across Canada are creating Passports right now. Storing certifications. Building work history. Preparing for the next opportunity.

When you join OnRopePro, you're not just getting software. You're getting access to a network of verified professionals who are already onboarded.

That Level 2 tech who applies next month? They might already have a Passport. Their certifications are verified. Their banking details are stored. Their safety rating is established.

One click to connect. Ten seconds to onboard. Back to billable work.

Every tech who joins the network makes your next hire faster. Every employer who joins makes the Passport more valuable for techs. The network grows in both directions.

The question isn't whether your industry will standardize on digital credentials. It's whether you'll be ahead of it or behind it.

## 10. How This Improves Your Business

### Section Header
**Stop Managing Paperwork. Start Managing Projects.**

### Body Copy
How many hours does your office spend on onboarding paperwork every month?

Forms sent. Forms returned. Forms missing. Forms re-sent. Certifications verified. Banking details entered. Safety documents signed (eventually). Everything filed (somewhere).

That's admin time. Not billable time. Not project time. Not growth time.

OnRopePro shifts the burden from your office to the tech's Passport. They fill everything out once. You receive it instantly, every time they connect.

Your onboarding becomes: Search license number. Send invitation. Receive profile. Done.

Your compliance becomes: Tech logs in. Signs documents. Starts work. Records kept.

Your payroll becomes: Hours logged. Data synced. Disputes eliminated.

The techs who use OnRopePro get faster onboarding, automatic hour tracking, and a portable career record. You get verified credentials, guaranteed compliance, and hours of admin time back every week.

That time goes back into running projects. Growing the business. Actually building something.

## 11. FAQs

**"What if a tech doesn't have an OnRopePro Passport?"**

You can still add them as an employee the traditional way. But you'll collect their information manually, verify certifications yourself, and chase safety acknowledgments via email. The value of Passports is that everything is already done.

**"How do techs get Passports?"**

Technicians create free accounts at onrope.pro/technician. They enter their information once, store certifications, and connect to employers as needed. Encourage your current techs to create Passports. They'll benefit from portable work history, and you'll benefit from automatic data transfer when future techs already have profiles.

**"What information do I see before a tech approves the connection?"**

License number search shows: name, certification level, First Aid status, and location. Full profile access (banking, work history, safety rating) requires the tech's approval.

**"Can techs change their information after connecting?"**

Yes. If a tech updates their address or banking details, the changes sync to all connected employers automatically. No more outdated forms in your files.

**"Is sensitive data secure?"**

All financial data (banking, SIN) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM and stored on SOC2 Type II compliant infrastructure. OnRopePro operates in compliance with PIPEDA (Canada) and applicable provincial privacy legislation.

**"What happens when a tech leaves my company?"**

Their Passport (certifications, work history, safety rating) stays with them. Your company retains records of work they completed while connected. Clean separation for both sides.

**"Can I require techs to use OnRopePro?"**

Yes. Many employers will find it valuable to require techs to create Passports as a condition of employment. The tech gets portable work history. You get automatic onboarding. Both sides benefit.

**"How does this work with existing employees?"**

Invite existing employees to create Passports. Once they do, their future work sessions log automatically. Historical data from before they had Passports stays in your existing records.

**"What does this cost?"**

Technician Passports are free for techs. For employers, OnRopePro pricing is $99/month base plus $34.95 per employee. Passports are included, not a separate charge.

**"How do I get started?"**

Create an employer account at onrope.pro. Invite your current techs to create Passports. Start experiencing 10-second onboarding with your next hire.

## Format-Specific Notes

**Technical Requirements:**
- No em-dashes (they break TSX rendering)
- All copy uses present tense for features
- Active voice throughout
- Specific numbers where validated
- B2B tone: professional but human, ROI-focused
- All problems sourced from Tommy/Glenn transcript dated December 14, 2025

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Hero section: Professional, clean, immediate value proposition
- Problem section: Use contrast (60 minutes vs 10 seconds visual)
- Feature cards: Icon + benefit statement + details
- Network section: Consider counter showing # of techs (when available)
- FAQs: Accordion format, address objections directly
- Dual CTA: Primary action + secondary "learn more" option

**Key Messaging Differences from Tech-Focused Page:**
- Lead with business outcomes (time saved, risk reduced)
- Emphasize existing network (techs already onboarded)
- ROI language (admin hours, compliance costs)
- Proof points (audit-ready, dispute-proof)
- Lower friction CTA (trial vs signup)
