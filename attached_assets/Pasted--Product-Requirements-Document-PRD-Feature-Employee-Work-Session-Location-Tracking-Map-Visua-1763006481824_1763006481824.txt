Feature: Employee Work Session Location Tracking & Map Visualization

Prepared for: Development Team
Prepared by: Project Owner
Date: November 2025

⸻

1. 🎯 Objective

Integrate a location tracking system that captures the GPS coordinates of employees when they start and end their work sessions.
The goal is to allow administrators to view those recorded locations on a map when reviewing an employee’s session data.

The system must be:
	•	Secure and privacy-compliant,
	•	Seamlessly integrated into the existing app,
	•	Professionally designed and intuitive,
	•	Fully tested on both front- and back-end before release.

2. 📍 Feature Requirements

A. Location Capture on Session Start/End
	•	When an employee taps “Start Day”:
	•	The app requests the user’s current GPS location (latitude, longitude).
	•	The coordinates and timestamp are saved with the work session record.
	•	When an employee taps “End Day”:
	•	The app again captures the current location and saves it to the same session record.
	•	Each session should therefore store:
	•	Employee ID
	•	Session ID
	•	Start time
	•	Start latitude/longitude
	•	End time
	•	End latitude/longitude
	•	Notes (if applicable)

⸻

B. Map Visualization
	•	In the admin dashboard, when viewing an employee’s work session:
	•	Display a map (using Google Maps API or Leaflet.js) with:
	•	A start location pin (green)
	•	An end location pin (red)
	•	A connecting line between the two points.
	•	Hovering over a pin shows:
	•	Timestamp (start or end)
	•	Address (reverse geocoded from coordinates).

⸻

C. Permissions & Access
	•	Only users with the permission "can_view_employee_location" (added to the permission dashboard) can access this data.
	•	Employees can see only their own start/end locations.
	•	Admins can view all employee sessions.
	•	Unauthorized users must receive a clean “Access Restricted” message — no console or API exposure.

⸻

D. User Experience
	•	Simple and modern design consistent with the rest of the application.
	•	The map view should open in a modal or on a dedicated “Session Details” page.
	•	Ensure map pins load quickly (≤ 2 seconds).
	•	Display coordinates and time beneath the map as fallback info.
	•	Responsive layout compatible with desktop and tablet.

⸻

3. ⚙️ Technical Implementation (High-Level)

A. Frontend
	•	Use React.js (confirm framework) with:
	•	Geolocation API to capture GPS data.
	•	Map integration via Google Maps API or Leaflet.js.
	•	Modal or page component to render the session map.
	•	Include error handling for:
	•	GPS denied permission.
	•	GPS unavailable.
	•	Offline conditions.

B. Backend
	•	Extend the existing session endpoints:
	•	POST /sessions/start → record start time & location.
	•	POST /sessions/end → record end time & location.
	•	GET /sessions/:id → return both locations for display.
	•	Validate that:
	•	Requests come from authenticated users.
	•	Employees cannot modify GPS data manually.
	•	Use server-side validation to ensure coordinates are valid (within realistic range).
	•	Optional: reverse-geocode to generate a human-readable address (using Google Geocoding API).

4. 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Every component must be tested before delivery.
Component	Test Type	Tools	Criteria
Geolocation Capture	Unit / Functional	Jest, Cypress	Accurate coordinate capture; graceful fail on denied permissions
Backend API	Integration	Mocha / Supertest	Valid data persistence, proper validation
Map Display	UI / Functional	Cypress / Playwright	Correct pin placement, line rendering, and timestamps
Permissions	Access Control	Jest / Manual QA	Admins only see all; employees see only their own
Data Accuracy	Manual Validation	—	Coordinates match approximate real-world locations
Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Start and end locations captured and stored correctly.
	•	Map view displays both points with correct timestamps.
	•	Permissions fully respected (no leaks or bypasses).
	•	Zero console or network errors.
	•	Automated tests achieve ≥ 90% coverage for this feature.

5. 🚀 Development Workflow
	1.	Create branch feature/session-location-tracking.
	2.	Implement backend API extensions → test via Postman.
	3.	Add geolocation capture and map components → test front-end.
	4.	Integrate permissions → test with various roles.
	5.	Conduct end-to-end QA (functional, UI, performance).
	6.	Submit logs or demo confirming 100% error-free behavior.
	7.	Deploy to staging → validate for 24 hours → approve production release.

6. ✅ Completion Definition
	•	Start/End session captures location accurately.
	•	Map visualization loads instantly and displays correctly.
	•	Permissions enforced 100%.
	•	No console or API errors.
	•	Fully tested and verified — ready for production on first release.
