## Rationale

**Why job board leads:**
- January = hiring season (employers planning crews)
- New Year resolution timing (improve operations)
- Network effects proof (techs already on platform)
- Unique value vs. generic business software
- Creates urgency (techs are there, you're not)

**Why "1000's of techs":**
- Social proof (platform has momentum)
- Addresses real pain (finding qualified techs is hard)
- Differentiator (no other platform has this database)
- Loss aversion (miss out on the talent pool)

**Psychology Stack:**
- Loss Aversion: Techs are finding jobs without you
- Social Proof: 1000's already on platform
- Timing/Urgency: Hiring season is now
- Exclusivity: Rope Access Only (not generic job boards)

---

## Implementation Notes

- "1000's" vs "1,000+" - use whichever is more accurate at launch
- Job board checkmark should be FIRST (primary differentiator)
- "Rope Access Only" emphasizes industry specificity
- Keep "every drop" addition - shows granular tracking
