## LEFT COLUMN (70%) — Marketing Copy

### Hero Section

**Primary Headline:**

The free professional profile for rope access technicians. Your certifications, work history, and reputation—portable, verified, and yours forever.

### Section 1: The Problem (Agitate)

**Section Header:**
## You've earned your reputation. Why does it disappear every time you change jobs?

**Body Copy:**

Eight years on rope. Level 3 IRATA. Hundreds of buildings. Zero safety incidents.

None of that follows you.

New employer? You're a stranger with a certification card. Back to proving yourself on easy jobs while the loud guy who's been there six months gets the high-rise work.

Your paper logbook is a mess. Your certifications are scattered across three email accounts. Your banking info? You're filling it out for the fourth time this year.

**This isn't how professionals work.**

---

### Section 2: The Solution (Introduce)

**Section Header:**
## One profile. Every job. Forever yours.

**Body Copy:**

OnRopePro gives you a portable professional identity that stays with you—no matter where you work.

**Your credentials, verified:**
IRATA/SPRAT ID, first aid, driver's abstract—stored securely, shared when YOU connect.

**Your history, preserved:**
Every work session, every building, every task. Scan your paper logbook pages to digitize years of experience.

**Your documents, ready:**
Banking info, void cheque, emergency contact—auto-shared only when you join a new employer. No more paperwork on day one.

**Your future, protected:**
30-day certification expiry alerts. Never get caught with a lapsed IRATA again.

---

### Section 3: What You Get (Features → Benefits)

**Section Header:**
## Built for how you actually work

**Feature Grid:**

| What You Get | Why It Matters |

| **Logbook Scanner** | Photograph paper pages → digitized, searchable records. Never lose your history. |
| **Secure Document Vault** | SIN, banking, void cheque—encrypted storage, shared only with your permission. |
| **Expiry Alerts** | 30 days before your IRATA/SPRAT expires. Your employer sees it too. Zero surprises. |
| **Exportable History (Plus)** | PDF work history for job applications. Prove 178 rope transfers, not just "experienced." |

### Section 4: Free vs Plus

**Section Header:**
## Free forever. Plus when you share.

**Comparison:**

### Tech Standard — $0
Everything you need to own your professional identity:
- Connect to 1 employer
- Professional profile with verified credentials
- Secure document vault
- Full work session logging
- Logbook photo scanning
- Emergency contact storage
- Referral code

### Tech Plus — $0 (1 referral)
Share your code with one tech. When they sign up, you both unlock Plus:
- **Everything in Standard**
- PLUS badge on your profile
- Safety Rating score (0-100) with improvement recommendations
- 30-day certification expiry alerts
- **Unlimited employer connections** (moonlight weekends, run your own clients)
- **Exportable work history PDF** (select date range, download professional record)
- Work history analytics (lifetime totals by task type)
- Resume storage
- Job board access (industry-specific postings)

**CTA:**
`Get Your Free Profile →`

*Share with one tech. You both get Plus. It's that simple.*

---

### Section 5: How It Works

**Section Header:**
## 2 minutes to start. Yours for life.

**Steps:**

**1. Create your free profile**
Name, email, IRATA/SPRAT ID. That's it.

**2. Add your credentials**
Upload certifications, first aid, driver's abstract. Stored securely.

**3. Start logging (or scan your old logbook)**
New work sessions auto-track. Old paper pages become searchable digital records.

**4. Share your referral code**
One tech signs up → you both unlock Plus. No commission schemes. Just mutual benefit.

**CTA:**
`Create Your Free Profile →`

---

### Section 6: For the Skeptics

**Section Header:**
## "What's the catch?"

**FAQ Format:**

**Why is this free?**
Employers pay. You don't. When you bring your verified profile to a new company, they save hours of onboarding paperwork. That's worth paying for. Your career data stays yours forever—we just make it portable.

**Who owns my data?**
You do. Export it anytime. Delete it anytime. Your profile, your rules.

**What if my employer doesn't use OnRopePro?**
You still get all the personal benefits—document storage, logbook digitization, certification tracking. When they do eventually adopt it (most do), you're already set up.

**Is my SIN/banking info safe?**
Bank-level encryption. Shared only when YOU connect to an employer. Never sold. Never shared otherwise.

**What's the referral thing about?**
Share your unique code. When one tech signs up using it, you both get Plus. Not MLM. Not commission. Just both of you getting upgraded for free.

### Section 7: Final CTA

**Section Header:**

Stop leaving it behind.

## RIGHT COLUMN (30%) — Scrolling Problems

**Design Notes:**
- Multiple rows of horizontally auto-scrolling text
- Alternating scroll directions (row 1 left, row 2 right, row 3 left, etc.)
- Muted/gray text color, smaller font than main copy
- Each problem is a short, punchy phrase
- Problems scroll continuously, creating ambient awareness of pain points
- On hover: scroll pauses (optional)

### Row 1 (scroll left)
```
New job, same paperwork again • Proving yourself from zero • Where's my first aid cert? • Can't find my logbook • Filling out banking forms for the 4th time • IRATA expiring next week • Nobody told me •
```

### Row 2 (scroll right)
```
Lost 3 hours to admin • Paper logbook is a disaster • Can't remember what I worked on • Certification scattered everywhere • New employer treats me like a rookie • Work history doesn't follow me •
```

### Row 3 (scroll left)
```
$63 missing from my check • Supervisor logged wrong hours • My word against a spreadsheet • Payroll disputes every month • "I swear I worked 9 hours" • Can't prove anything •
```

### Row 4 (scroll right)
```
Indeed is useless for rope access jobs • Where are the good postings? • How do I prove 8 years experience? • Gut feel isn't negotiation leverage • High performer, average review •
```

### Row 5 (scroll left)
```
Safety records stayed with last employer • Can't prove training history • Paper forms "somewhere in a truck" • Audit asks for 6 months of inspections • My reputation locked in someone else's filing cabinet •
```

### Row 6 (scroll right)
```
Moonlighting is a coordination nightmare • Can't work two companies easily • Weekends wasted on admin • No way to track multiple employers • Building my own client base with no system •
```

### Row 7 (scroll left)
```
Onboarding takes half a day • Same questions every job • Emergency contact forms again • Voided cheque request #47 • Why doesn't this follow me? • Starting over is exhausting •
```

### Row 8 (scroll right)
```
Career progress invisible • No data for raise negotiations • Performance measured by politics not output • High performers unrecognized • Coasters get the same treatment • Where's the proof? •
```

## A/B Test Recommendations

**Test 1: Headline Framing**
- A: Loss framing ("Your career doesn't follow you")
- B: Gain framing ("Own your career data forever")
- Why: Loss aversion may outperform, but gain framing could feel more empowering

**Test 2: CTA Copy**
- A: "Create Your Free Profile"
- B: "Claim Your Free Profile"
- C: "Get Started Free"
- Why: "Claim" implies ownership/entitlement; "Get Started" is action-oriented

**Test 3: Social Proof Placement**
- A: Trust signals in hero section
- B: Trust signals after problem section
- Why: May convert better after pain points are established

**Test 4: Referral Framing**
- A: "Share with one tech → you both get Plus"
- B: "Unlock Plus together—just one referral"
- Why: Testing reciprocal framing vs. achievement framing

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Scrolling Problems Column

```css
/* Example CSS for scrolling rows */
.problem-row {
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  animation: scroll-left 30s linear infinite;
}

.problem-row.reverse {
  animation: scroll-right 30s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes scroll-left {
  0% { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

@keyframes scroll-right {
  0% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

/* Styling */
.problem-row {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #6b7280; /* gray-500 */
  padding: 12px 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
}
```

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop:** 70/30 split side by side
- **Tablet:** 60/40 split, smaller font
- **Mobile:** Stack vertically—marketing copy first, then 3-4 problem rows as ambient footer

### Color Palette Suggestion

- **Primary CTA:** Orange (#f97316) or Green (#22c55e) — stands out, action-oriented
- **Text:** Dark gray (#1f2937) for readability
- **Problem column:** Light gray (#6b7280) — ambient, not distracting
- **Background:** White main column, light gray (#f9fafb) problem column
