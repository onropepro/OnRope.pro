            <h2>Core Platform Features & Capabilities</h2>

            <h3>1. Multi-Job-Type Project Management</h3>
            <p>
                The platform intelligently adapts its tracking and visualization systems to accommodate different types of rope access work, recognizing that window cleaning operations differ fundamentally from parkade maintenance or in-suite servicing. This adaptive approach ensures that tracking metrics, progress visualization, and reporting align perfectly with the specific work being performed.
            </p>

            <h4>4-Elevation Building Jobs (Window Cleaning, Pressure Washing, Dryer Vent Cleaning)</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Visual Tracking System:</strong> The signature "4-Elevation Building System" displays four building faces side-by-side (North, East, South, West), each with independent horizontal progress bars that fill from left to right as work is completed.</p>
                <p><strong>Independent Elevation Tracking:</strong> Each building face is tracked separately, allowing technicians to work on different elevations simultaneously while maintaining accurate progress records for each direction.</p>
                <p><strong>Drop-Based Progress:</strong> Technicians log "drops" (vertical descents) completed per elevation. The system automatically calculates completion percentages based on total drops planned versus drops completed for each direction.</p>
                <p><strong>Dynamic Floor Count Display:</strong> Visual representation shows the number of floors serviced, with real-time updates as drops are logged.</p>
                <p><strong>Daily Drop Targets:</strong> Configure expected drops per day to measure productivity and identify when additional resources may be needed.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Parkade/Underground Garage Jobs</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Stall-Based Tracking:</strong> Monitor work completion by individual parking stalls cleaned or serviced rather than building elevations.</p>
                <p><strong>Daily Stall Targets:</strong> Set and track expected stalls per day to ensure project stays on schedule.</p>
                <p><strong>Completion Progress:</strong> Visual progress indicators show stalls completed versus total stalls in the parkade.</p>
                <p><strong>Level Organization:</strong> Organize work by parkade levels (P1, P2, P3, etc.) for structured tracking.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>In-Suite Interior Work (Dryer Vent Cleaning)</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Unit-by-Unit Tracking:</strong> Monitor which residential or commercial units have been serviced.</p>
                <p><strong>Suite Scheduling:</strong> Track daily suite targets and completion rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Floor Organization:</strong> Group units by floor for logical work progression tracking.</p>
                <p><strong>Resident Coordination:</strong> Link suite work with resident complaints or service requests for comprehensive service tracking.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Project Setup & Configuration</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Strata Plan Numbers:</strong> Unique building identifiers for multi-building companies managing dozens of properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Building Information:</strong> Store building name, address, floor counts, and property details for easy reference.</p>
                <p><strong>Job Type Selection:</strong> Choose from window cleaning, pressure washing, dryer vent cleaning, parkade maintenance, or in-suite work, which determines tracking methodology.</p>
                <p><strong>Target Completion Dates:</strong> Set expected completion dates to track schedule adherence and identify delays early.</p>
                <p><strong>Estimated Hours:</strong> Input estimated total hours for budget comparison against actual hours worked.</p>
                <p><strong>PDF Rope Access Plans:</strong> Upload detailed rope access and fall protection plans directly to projects for safety compliance and technician reference.</p>
                <p><strong>Daily Targets:</strong> Configure daily drop targets, stall targets, or suite targets based on job type to measure productivity.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. Real-Time Work Session & Hours Tracking for Payroll</h3>
            <p>
                One of the platform's most critical capabilities is its comprehensive work session and hours tracking system, designed specifically to provide the precise time data needed for accurate payroll processing while simultaneously enabling real-time labor cost monitoring for project budget management.
            </p>

            <h4>Start/End Day Functionality</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Work Session Initiation:</strong> Technicians use the "Start Day" function when arriving at a job site. The system captures the exact timestamp (date, time) and associates the session with the specific project and technician.</p>
                <p><strong>Project Selection:</strong> When starting a session, technicians select which project they're working on, ensuring hours are attributed to the correct job for client billing and cost tracking.</p>
                <p><strong>Session Completion:</strong> The "End Day" function records the exact ending timestamp, calculating total time worked automatically.</p>
                <p><strong>Multi-Project Days:</strong> If a technician works on multiple projects in one day, they can end one session and start another, maintaining separate time records for each project.</p>
                <p><strong>Historical Entries:</strong> Supervisors can create work session entries for past dates to capture missed time entries or correct errors.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Employee Hourly Rate Management</h4>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <p><strong>Individual Rate Configuration:</strong> Each employee has a configurable hourly rate stored in their profile, accessible to company owners and operations managers.</p>
                <p><strong>IRATA Level Differentiation:</strong> Rates can be set based on IRATA certification levels (Level 1, 2, or 3), reflecting different skill levels and experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Role-Based Rates:</strong> Different rates for Rope Access Technicians, Supervisors, and Operations Managers based on responsibilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Rate Update History:</strong> When rates change, historical work sessions maintain their original rates to ensure accurate historical cost calculations.</p>
                <p><strong>Permission-Based Access:</strong> Only users with financial data permissions can view hourly rates, maintaining payroll privacy.</p>
            </div>
