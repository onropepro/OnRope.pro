# SCR Rating System

## Harness Inspection Points

1 point will be awarded per project completed for harness inspection completed for every work session.

If there are 10 work sessions and only 8 harness inspections completed for the project, then the SCR is awarded 0.8 points.

Formula: Points = (Completed Harness Inspections / Total Work Sessions) per project

---

## Project Documentation Points

1 point will be awarded per project with all required documents uploaded. Partial credit is proportional.

Example: 2 out of 4 docs uploaded = 0.5 points

### Elevation/Rope Access Projects (4 documents required)
- Rope Access Plan
- Anchor Inspection
- Toolbox Meeting
- FLHA

### Non-Elevation Projects (2 documents required)
- Toolbox Meeting
- FLHA

Note: Projects that do not require anchor use and rope access work do NOT need Rope Access Plan and Anchor Inspection documents. These projects earn 1 point for having Toolbox Meeting and FLHA completed.

Formula: Points = (Uploaded Required Documents / Total Required Documents) per project
