# SCR Rating System

## Harness Inspection Points

1 point will be awarded per project completed for harness inspection completed for every work session.

If there are 10 work sessions and only 8 harness inspections completed for the project, then the SCR is awarded 0.8 points.

Formula: Points = (Completed Harness Inspections / Total Work Sessions) per project
