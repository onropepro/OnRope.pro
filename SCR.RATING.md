# SCR Rating System

## Harness Inspection Points

1 point will be awarded per project completed for harness inspection completed for every work session.

If there are 10 work sessions and only 8 harness inspections completed for the project, then the SCR is awarded 0.8 points.

Formula: Points = (Completed Harness Inspections / Total Work Sessions) per project

---

## Project Documentation Points

1 point will be awarded per project with all required documents uploaded. Partial credit is proportional.

Example: 2 out of 4 docs uploaded = 0.5 points

### Elevation/Rope Access Projects (4 documents required)
- Rope Access Plan
- Anchor Inspection
- Toolbox Meeting
- FLHA

### Non-Elevation Projects (2 documents required)
- Toolbox Meeting
- FLHA

Note: Projects that do not require anchor use and rope access work do NOT need Rope Access Plan and Anchor Inspection documents. These projects earn 1 point for having Toolbox Meeting and FLHA completed.

Formula: Points = (Uploaded Required Documents / Total Required Documents) per project

---

## Company Documentation Points

1 point will be awarded if all 3 documents are uploaded.

### Required Documents (3 total)
- Health and Safety Manual
- Company Policy
- Certificate of Insurance

Example: 1 out of 3 docs uploaded = 0.33 points

Formula: Points = (Uploaded Documents / 3)

---

## Employee Document Review Points

1 point will be awarded to the SCR for each employee that has viewed and signed company documents, safe work procedures, and safe work practices.

The calculation is based on the documents actually uploaded by the company.

Example: If a company has only 2 out of 3 documents uploaded, and an employee views and signs both documents, that employee has signed 100% of available documents. The SCR is awarded 1 point for that employee.

Formula: SCR Points per employee = (Documents Signed by Employee / Documents Uploaded by Company)
